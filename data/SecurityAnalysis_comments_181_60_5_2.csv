ggq2a16;5;Appreciate the DD on a micro cap name. I’m still looking for more information on why the market will realize this is mis-priced. How do pure play student loan collectors get valued? The valuation seems so off from its healthcare collection peers that the market seems to be looking at this name entirely differently. The other note about the peer group is that none of them are micro caps. The next smallest company was still 50x the market cap of PFMT. Do they have a concentrated percent of revenue from a small number of customers? Are their customers nation wide? There’s a disconnect somewhere as to why it’s currently so mis-valued that I’d like to understand more.;t3_ki8z2q;t3_ki8z2q;1608667495.0

Disruptive and innovative technology in this context refers to what PFMT has over the competitors. The competition has been using a ""one-size-fits all approach"" to their customers whereas PFMT uses their proprietary software to scrap through data and find more potentially recoverable claims. 

Their solutions are also more client-centric than the competition. As a smaller player, they can be nimble and provide customized solutions to fulfill each clients needs. For this reason they have been rewarded with new contracts. See the recent presentations (on their website) for case study examples of how superior their approach is relative to the incumbent competition. ";t1_ggpljph;t3_ki8z2q;1608661729.0

I think the biggest risk to the tech companies is a combo of anti trust & debundling where startups pick away at their ecosystem one by one.

It is completely given that EBITDA and Mcap will have low coeff because the source data are in the 4 or more digits (tens of thousand), vs revenue growth with only 1 digits (less than 1 or 100%).

If one variable has average number of 100.000 and the other variable has average value of 0.5. Both can be equally significant while yielding low coefficient.

For illustrative purpose, if you make a regression with 

dependent variable = number of luxury bag your purchase

independent variable 1 = how much is your annual income (in $)

indepedent variable 2 = how many luxury shoes you have (in pieces)

I can assure you that independent variable 1 will have very low coefficient. Does that mean it is insignificant? I don't think so.";t3_kh7mos;t3_kh7mos;1608554047.0
ggk8np1;8;"This is awesome and really well done. Made a lot of these regressions in my analyst days and regrettably passed off a lot of low r^2's haha. 

Depending on the prevailing sentiment of the market, sometimes it's worthwhile to incorporate profitability measured by either FCF or Adj. EBITDA margin. For FCF would just make sure to include a 12 month figure given the potential seasonality of Billings and for EBITDA would add back SBC. You may already be familiar with it but the 'rule of 40' was pretty commonly referred to for a few years, which was a hypothetical threshold of a combined revenue growth + FCF margin of 40%. The contribution of profitability to that implied EV/Rev multiple has degraded over time as the market increasingly prioritizes growth above all else... which is the conclusion you just arrived at.

Profitability measures can obviously be useful in assessing whether the company is overly reliant on S&M spend to push a bad product, but they can also unfairly punish quality R&D spend. This analysis does a cool job of incorporating sales efficiency. I really just wrote this incoherent rambling response to share it with you. Hope you enjoy.

Edit: Just want to add that if you aren't already familiar with it, I would also highly recommend reading David Skok's SaaS Metrics 2.0. It does a really great job of breaking down some of the other useful performance measures for SaaS companies. You're already obviously clued in on LTV and CAC but I guess I'm just in the habit of trying to share it with everyone because it was really helpful to me haha.

Double edit: A lot of the metrics mentioned by David Skok won't be available in disclosures, but you can approximate certain things like Billings = Revenue + Change in Deferred and Bookings = Revenue + Change in RPO. Sometimes these are better indicators of performance than revenue growth given they are more forward looking.

ggmbkm3;2;"Appreciate the feedback. The avg. EBITDA and Market Cap for the data set is $1bn and $31bn respectively, but I ran the regression in millions so let's call it $1k and $31k. Multiplying that by each of their coefficients is -$1.75 and $2.42, which is still smaller than the revenue growth coefficient multiplied by the average growth rate which is 6. The negative EBITDA coefficient implies that investors reward companies that lose money. Does correlation equal causation? It's more likely that high growth companies are more likely to lose money, and investors are rewarding the high growth and not the EBITDA losses. 

The bigger concern is that the R2 only goes up by a few percentage points by including both of these metrics in the regression, so it doesn't seem to be adding much value by including them.";t1_ggkx5fa;t3_kh7mos;1608582071.0

But I have heard similar things being discussed in the realm of algorithmic underwriting for insurance. 

I’d imagine the concept you mentioned ultimately also depend on some more rigorous model such as some PD metric. 

I think what stops this area from being more “marketable” as supposed to equities is that most of these models or ‘algos’ are very proprietary. There is no unification of exchange or public database probably due to the more private nature of smaller businesses. I think public available data and consistent data is key for something to be come more robustly valued and traded.

ggel11j;2;The reason data and algorithmic/ML lending is more useful for consumer and small business like merchant cash advance is based on how quickly feedback is received and can be fed back into the models.

Loss rates between 4-8% for well-established cohorts.

gge5563;1;"I use risk calc as a challenger model to our internal models. Riskcalc can be a ok portfolio measure but it will never be used as a tool to underwrite. 

 1) when you bring a name to committee, you are selling the name on its competitive position and forecasts. Saying moodys riskcalc put them at a Ba3 because the liquidity factor is dragging them down won’t do shit — committee  already know that, they want to know what it looks like under certain Revenue assumptions or management actions.

2) consumer are largely homogeneous. Companies are not and are largely influenced by the idiosyncrasies (laws, covenants, binary events, etc.). Every fin tech ABS issuance has performed terribly. 

3) quant models are largely point in time models. Management strategy (and turnover) can wildly change the credit risk (and Loss given default) of a company. 

4)the whole point of direct lending is to provide a unique financing solution. The amount of business that would be lost because the model only allows for 3 year vs 5 year tenor would be huge - it is NOT easy to bring in lending relationships. 

5) for all the ones that were turned down by the fundamental players, there is a great deal of adverse selection in the borrowers left. 

6) false positives — these models have roughly a 70%? (Not sure about this) Accuracy rates. There’s going to be a lot of loans that go sour that should not have been originated upon a deeper dive. 

8) MM borrowers take a lot of creativity in their financial reporting - you can’t trust the data a lot to the times and need a couple rounds of back and forth to get an accurate assessment.

gge5o0v;1;"Very interesting question. A couple of thoughts:

1. MM lending (at least in Europe) is a lot of times in support of PE-led transactions. As such, it's hard to state the upside purely on financial metrics-basis and involves a lot of qualitative factors hard to capture (e.g. sector positioning, customer concentration etc)
2. DL funds sometimes do sponsor CLO's as well, but in my experience, there a lot of the loans in their DL portfolio were smaller than what you see in the HY/CLO markets";t3_kgajeq;t3_kgajeq;1608407403.0

While I think that quant models may be able to help lenders avoid some mistakes, a lot of times (especially with lower middle market companies), the ""edge"" comes from the terms and conditions. It could be the use of collateral, warrants/equity stakes and/or covenants. 

Small firms are quirky. I've talked to BDC executives who would conduct due diligence on an otherwise great little business, and the owner logs into Quickbooks(!) to show them financials.  Sometimes the risk isn't the business model, but the management or employees. Is the firm going to get raided by ICE a month after closing? Does management have enough skin in the game to stay focused, even after getting a big payday?

The bond market (also debt market or credit market) is a financial market where participants can issue new debt, known as the primary market, or buy and sell debt securities, known as the secondary market. This is usually in the form of bonds, but it may include notes, bills, and so on. Its primary goal is to provide long-term funding for public and private expenditures. The bond market has largely been dominated by the United States, which accounts for about 39% of the market.

Something that isn't widely appreciated is how much of an edge Intel has historically gained from extremely close integration between design and process development. Tailoring process characteristics to the needs of the design teams and designing products for exact process characteristics allows pushing silicon to the economically viable limit. That dynamic doesn't exist for foundry customers.

Intel's processes aren't a good fit for the general market. TSMC notably leads with a low power optimized process before launching a performance version. Smartphone producers et al aren't likely to jump ship for a process that won't meet their power targets.

So for Intel to become a seriously competitive foundry they would have a choice.

1) Split process development and fab buildout efforts to cater for both foundry market requirements and the first party CPU business

or

2) Make concessions in process design priorities to benefit the foundry business at the expense of the CPU business

It's conceivable that with enough commercial success as a foundry capital investment can be ramped up enough that (1) could be done with no drawbacks. But that is a hell of a gamble, and getting there would draw management attention and key technical talent away from the CPU business.

I doubt pushing the foundry business harder would have been a panacea.";t1_gg3b65b;t3_kei0p9;1608199698.0

gg3ny86;7;"Chip manufacturing is a scale business. You really need scale to compete.

What is wrong with Intel is very easy to see. They are losing their moat. No one knows how to deal with this problem, Intel included. Once they outsource CPU manufacturing, what exactly is their competitive advantage vs AMD? Once Risc V becomes mainstream, what exactly is their moat?";t1_gg3mvvx;t3_kei0p9;1608173359.0
gg3o2fb;2;">WebAssembly

a lot of the architectural improvements apple did with M1 have nothing to do with ARM and Intel has forced the industry to do the opposite for years just to sell more chips in a PC. the CPU, chipset and motherboard";t1_gg3mvvx;t3_kei0p9;1608173420.0
gg3lg32;3;"WebAssembly is a true write once run anywhere platform. Java, .Net all tried to do this but they were too much associated with individual companies. WebAssembly has the support of all the big software companies, so it really stands a chance of becoming an universal app platform.

Once lots of apps start targeting WebAssembly, it becomes irrelevant what CPU you run. You can run x86, x64, ARM, RISC V and it would all just run fine. At that point, Intel's lock on the x86 will become increasingly irrelevant.";t1_gg3fxu7;t3_kei0p9;1608172053.0
gg519b5;3;"I agree with you, it is rare for an option to completely be without tradeoffs. Vertical integration has its benefits, but also its tradeoffs.

The main issue here is profit/cost trends. The x86 CPU market is not getting significantly bigger or more profitable over time, but latest generation foundries are getting much more expensive. The profitability of the vertically integrated model will inevitably erode due to these trends.

The choices that made sense in the past no longer make sense, and change is painful/expensive. I think the right move at this point is for Intel to give up on the foundry business (too capital intensive, not enough scale to compete) and milk the x86 business for cashflow (minimize R&D investments into x86). The focus should be to identify new businesses that Intel can dominate and pour resources into that.

What is really alarming for Intel is their terrible track record of expanding into new businesses. Their 5G modem attempt was pretty bad.";t1_gg4n95r;t3_kei0p9;1608212165.0

gg3pido;16;"The “moat” if you require one is a huge installed user base of x86 machines. 40 years of software development on that platform, backwards compatibility since for-fucking-ever (up for debate if that’s a good thing or not, but business-wise I believe it is), and the fact that they don’t have to be the ONLY chipmaker to be a good business. If “technically superior” meant greater adoption, you’d have an ALPHA machine and Oracle would be the world’s biggest chipmaker because everything else would be running SPARC.

There were a lot of years where Intel wasn’t the only game in town. they were a while ago and out of most people’s memory though...

When you’re not apple, and you don’t control every corner of your ecosystem on the hardware side and the software side it’s non-trivial to just dump decades of development.

There is room for Intel and AMD, and Intel can still be a good buy if you value it that way. The only way it’s *not* a good buy is if x86 is dead. I don’t believe it is. While there’s certainly good conversation to that effect, I’m not convinced. There’s always been superior technology. that’s not going to change, but it hasn’t stopped the platform in the past. ARM and POWER have been around forever. what’s different now? I’m sure the apple distortion-field is at work here, and it’s hard to tease out where that begins and ends.";t1_gg3ny86;t3_kei0p9;1608174181.0
gg3qoya;1;I’m not trying to be obstinate, but what exactly did apple do with the M1? Clock for clock it’s not that far behind the 8cx and it’s 18 months newer. It has 2x the TDP and is on a smaller process. It’s impressive but... is it peerless? I, not so sure.;t1_gg3o2fb;t3_kei0p9;1608174833.0
gg3m9k3;2;Ok tqvm. Appreciate the reply.;t1_gg3lg32;t3_kei0p9;1608172481.0
gg4ka9u;1;wasm is nice to have, but does not change anything about intel’s situation. we’ve already found that given the resources, companies can make binary translators fast and usable. I doubt the cost of binary translation vs wasm runtime is too different. Anything perf sensitive will still be written for native.;t1_gg3lg32;t3_kei0p9;1608196652.0
ggjsbyd;1;"yeah tho WASM is only really made for webapps... Anything that require more native solutions won't really work...

Plus there's still an efficiency question that goes with it. Can ARM run much faster than x64 (compared to AMD at least)? For low performance ARM can clearly be a winner, but anything very high performance it doesn't seem so yet. But I guess we'll see with time.

Then, the VM that is created for WASM needs to be compiled to the native code. The OS still needs to run on the cpu as well.

I think from now on tho, there will be more and more ARM computers coming out for sure, perhaps hybrids as well";t1_gg3lg32;t3_kei0p9;1608519895.0

gg3ytnz;5;"x86 isn't dead, but it also won't have much of a moat going forward.

I think you are severely overestimating the amount of software that is difficult to port off of x86. Java has been around for 25 years. .NET has been around for 20. Most software have been written in languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, Javascript, Java, C#/.NET, Go for decades now. It is very easy to port software written in these languages to new hardware architectures.

In reality there is only a thin sliver of software that is hardware dependent. These are usually things like drivers and numeric libraries. Vast majority of software is now developed in higher level languages that are very much platform independent.";t1_gg3pido;t3_kei0p9;1608179427.0
gg3qu9a;2;"You know how that moat goes away in 5 years? ARM chips make their way onto laptops and windows gets efficient arm transpilation. Consumers don't care about hardware. They only care about compatibility and price.

But anyways my thesis is simple: you put a bean counter at the head of hard sciences company and it will die. Simple as that. It's why I'll never put my money in boeing, intel, or other financial engineering bullshit companies.";t1_gg3pido;t3_kei0p9;1608174916.0
gg3ret2;6;"every PC has a CPU, RAM, GPU and chipset to move data around the motherboard. the RAM and storage have to interface with the chipset. it's a separate chip that is built on an older process than the CPU. 20 some years ago the chipset was two chips and now it's one.

the M1, most of the chipset is built into the SoC and the storage, RAM and GPU interface directly with the SoC. Quicker pathways for data to move around and less resistance so battery life is longer.

On PC's there is a lot of essentially junk circuitry dedicated to controlling the movement of data around the system. and a lot of CPU cycles and data moving around is dedicated to simply controlling the movement of data.

AMD has done similar work with their game console CPU's and GPU's which is why the new generation of consoles are so much faster

around 15 years ago Nvidia had a shortlived chipset business for AMD CPU's and were the first ones to make the chipset a single chip. Even after that failed, Intel kept the two chip chipset for years which slowed things down.";t1_gg3qoya;t3_kei0p9;1608175232.0
gg4jpe6;1;tf are you talking about? There aren’t any good benchmarks for the 8cx, but if you look at the mobile variant of each (a14 vs 855), the A14 is around twice as fast per clock.;t1_gg3qoya;t3_kei0p9;1608196051.0
ggjtnsh;1;"I think the complexity of x86 is a major hinderance. It is better to have a simple CPU that is cheap on the transistor budget, and use the extra transistor budget on application specific co-processing modules. So instead of optimizing the CPU, it's better to just have dedicated co-processors for things like neural net inferencing, or signal processing, etc.

No amount of software optimization will match the performance of ASICs. I see the world increasingly moving toward a CPU+ model where the basic CPU is a commodity, and you customize it with on-die co-processors. This is basically the ARM model.";t1_ggjsbyd;t3_kei0p9;1608520643.0

gg3ro8t;5;"The last part is something I agree with for sure. The first part... what if I’m a huge multinational company with 10s of thousands of x86 workstations, servers and custom software.

Consumers don’t care about hardware, so why should Microsoft develop good transpilation/emulation? That’s a huge investment that is guaranteed to underperform native software. I own a WoA tablet and it’s... fine.  And it wasn’t significantly cheaper than an x86 tablet, it isn’t faster (although native arm apps are quite impressive for the power usage). So, while I agree that arm is a potential competitor, but other than transitioning to ARM “just because,” what is the deciding factor that drives the hassle and the investment?

Also... the people buying the hardware are definitely bean counters. So they have to be happy too.";t1_gg3qu9a;t3_kei0p9;1608175378.0
gg3ww4h;2;On that last point. No one complained during paul otellini's time 😶;t1_gg3qu9a;t3_kei0p9;1608178305.0
gg3uonx;3;"Atom is sic atom has been SoC for a while, and so have most other ARM packages. With a really tightly integrated system like Apple is making the design constraints are just different than intel’s market that might be a low end pc, a high end workstation, or a rack mount server in a data center.

Increased memory bandwidth can’t be the backbone of a platform when you need 16GB of ram to compete.

Also, the M1 benchmarks have been fundamentally flawed on their single core performance. Running a single thread on a current generation Intel processor will not max out a core. Benchmarks have shown the gap closing or eliminated when using properly crafted benchmarks that more closely resemble actual application loads (not just real world usage).

So, yes, the M1 is a very high peprforming ARM processor. But x86 killer? When you set the marketing aside, I’m not so sure.";t1_gg3ret2;t3_kei0p9;1608177063.0

ggm7q88;1;yeah I do agree on that one. I think that ARM has something special being not completely simple like MIPS and at the same time not completely over complexified like x86. I think it may be time for some change.  I don't think intel will be able to hold on tho.... unless management is completely changed.;t1_ggjtnsh;t3_kei0p9;1608580152.0

gg3shhr;3;"Then it just becomes a value trap right? Right now, it looks like the choices for the next several years are either AMD for x86 or whoever puts up ARM processors. It'll be at least 5 years of Ryzen domination before Intel can get their stuff together, and at that point AMD will have gained huge market share. Unless you're holding on a multi-decade time-frame, it doesn't make sense to buy Intel. 

The point is that Apple has shown that ARM chips are competitive with x86, and yet ARM is still in its relative infancy compared to x86. Microsoft already has a transpilation layer, they just need a reason to optimize it, and if ARM chips get better battery life than x86 ones, that is a great reason to do so.";t1_gg3ro8t;t3_kei0p9;1608175838.0

gg3wau8;5;"ARM is definitely not in its infancy. My theory on the M1 is that it was really for financial reasons. Apple already has the R&D and besides the display, the CPU is the most expensive part of apple machines. Apple has two ways of increasing revenue to keep their rediculous valuation up (separate topic lol): sell more machines (probably not gonna happen to a significant degree) or bring down costs and hold prices constant. In true apple style it’s framed as technologically superior, but really it’s about the same and the integration/packaging that their tight control allows is the secret sauce.

So they’ve decreased their costs significantly by using their own hardware, they haven’t decreased prices, and they’re holding their own vs Intel hardware in terms of performance. These aren’t considerations that someone like Dell has. they just make a box that gets the job done.

The total costs associated with a transition are huge both in terms of time and dollars. There has to be a better reason than “because the nerds know it’s better”...

gg5jjym;1;Hey there. I sourced the idea from ValueInvestorsClub... I know low effort. I think your point about the non-recurring revenue is very valid and a negative attribute that clouds this business model.

&nbsp.


I can't speculate on the market's reasoning for the 20% price drop over the last few months. I *can* say with good certainty that being


1) a sub-100m market cap security 


2) with zero analyst coverage 


3) multiple vectors for positive business inflection 


Gives the stock multiple reasons to have a depressed valuation and thereby offer skewed risk/reward.

I would also agree with the Jeremeh that ROIC may not be a great indicator. Their ""capital"" seems to be the relationships and goodwill they've built up with their clients.

gg7mpm3;1;I think you get the right idea. ro565 also explained it a bit. Generally software is not a capital intensive business. Generally management for software companies cannot plow money and expect the same ROIC, like a railroad or retail business or something.

gg75c9d;1;"
The company has 125m in current assets. Subtract cash/current liabilities, and you're left with a -7m net working capital position. Add 11m of long term assets back and... case in point, the business is actually employing only 4m of cash to operate (depending on how much cash you would like to add back to the asset base as a ""normalized cash position""). The specific number isn't important (40%, 50%, 60%). The point is it's very high. It's a positive in that it's evidently difficult for the management to plow money into the business at crappy rates of return and destroy shareholder wealth.


&nbsp.


I'm not aiming to calculate the traditional definition of ROIC. I'm aiming to get a handle on the practical true ""return on capital"" for the business. I use return on capital as a model of projecting future value of businesses, by way of future capital allocation. I also use it to compare the raw strength of different businesses. To that end, if you use a formulistic approach as is common with data providers (bloomberg, factset, et al) the metric fails in both regards. 


&nbsp.


For instance, in a case like this, cash comprises essentially all of WSTG's net working capital, and ~98% of ""invested capital"" with a 40.3m balance in the last quarter. The sudden inflow of cash due to the new receivables arrangement caused a temporarily inflated cash account. Thus, the current cash balance by no means represents the ""normalized"" cash position the business requires to operate. If assessing the strength of the business relative to other companies, or attempting to project the efficacy of future capital allocation for this business, including cash in return on capital doesn't make sense here. It's the same logic really as adjusting for special items or capitalizing certain expenses.

gg7csrh;1;Still a little confused about what your formula for true “return on capital” is. Because if you go to Q1 of this year, before the receivables arrangement screwed with the cash balance, their (traditional) ROIC (using NOPAT and the NWC method for invested capital) is still much much lower than you say. Their FCF, excluding Q2 of this year because of the change in non cash NWC has been negative every other quarter. I’m just not seeing how this is the “cash cow” that you say it is.;t1_gg75c9d;t3_keg9eq;1608254665.0
gg7gv5y;1;"Maybe this will make it more simple for you. Look at the last 10 years of the cash flow statement.  You have net 86m of cash inflow from operations, 4m cash inflow from investing, and about ~53m cash ***outflow*** from financing. Now think, what does that tell you? To me, that's a cash cow.


&nbsp.


If you're focusing on two quarters of negative FCF in the context of that information I think you miss the forest for the trees. How are you confused about my formula for return on capital? I pulled every variable for the denominator straight from the financials. The numerator you can decide whatever you want... it's going to be most likely in excess of 50% with 4m of capital employed in the denominator.";t1_gg7csrh;t3_keg9eq;1608256958.0
gg7j6va;1;"Thank you for clarifying. However, your analogy about the cash flows over the last 10 years is a little faulty. You first say that you cannot include the cash on their balance sheet for the ROIC calculation because it is not “normalized” and is a one time charge. Which I agree with. But if you consider that, then wouldn’t the 38.1mm in cash flow from operations over the LTM also be a one time charge? Then the cash flow from operations over the last 10 years would then be much lower than you cited if you adjust for the fact that the change in receivables is a one time thing. 

Also, NOPAT is around 0.75mm for Q3, and if you use 4mm as the invested capital number, then you get an return on capital of around 19%.

I know that I seem like I’m missing the forest for the trees but I was just looking into the very specific metrics that you used as a justification for why this company was being undervalued. Personally, I’m not seeing the value in this stock but I could be wrong.";t1_gg7gv5y;t3_keg9eq;1608258261.0

gg11f9k;50;"This is something I struggle with myself. Generally what I try to do is prioritize along the following lines (most important to least important. the further down the list I go, the more I tend to skim):

1) Company filings (10Ks, 10Qs, proxies, transcripts, etc)


2) Investment reading (books, interesting articles, etc)


3) News


4) Twitter (yes, twitter - I found that there's a lot of interesting content if you follow the right people)



Filings are at the top, because I can read all the investing books in the world, but if I don't look at companies and try to think of them I am the investor equivalent of an armchair general. Investment reading is basically education, so that's also pretty important. News, a lot of it you can skim and still get the idea, and the same thing with twitter.

Another thing is that sometimes you start reading something, and you realize the value-to-fluff ratio is low, so I try to drop it quickly. A lot of the flashy sell-side reports, McKinsey stuff, etc come to mind.

The other part of it is simply keeping track of what needs to be read first, and forcing myself to stick to the plan. Much easier said than done though, especially in this age of distraction. I'm gradually getting better though with practice. But I'm keen to hear strategies others use.";t3_ke8qcj;t3_ke8qcj;1608125316.0
gg1588v;15;Many books and articles unfortunately tend to include a lot of unneeded information. I believe that I do better by skipping unnecessary things.

gg1xjkb;10;"My process leans heavily on daily discipline for reading. I try to skim at least one q/k, one ec transcript, 3-4 new articles every morning before the open as part of my daily routine. Track the filings you read in a spreadsheet or notebook. Do this consistently for a year and you’ll have (hopefully) read about 200ish companies before ever having sat down to work. If you cover a single sector you might get through the relevant names quickly but you can replace a k with an industry report / chapter in a book / blog / podcast, the only key is you read / listen to something every morning that will add value to your idea gen / process. Get creative with it - sometimes I read entire filings on my phone, sometimes I print them out, I often replace articles with a youtube binge (there are some amazing investor interviews on there), VIC / Seeking Alpha articles are interesting to change it up. Books don’t have to be investment related (there are really a finite # that are worth reading cover to cover)... I read a lot of general history, military history, econ, psychology, sci fi. 

You will obviously do a lot of this during your work day (assuming you are buyside / sellside / idea gen) but I find mandating morning reading turns my brain on and some stuff carries on through the day into full fledged deep dives, mini projects, questions for management or sellsiders. You also start to learn which sources / people put out the best content. 

This strategy also assumes you get up early - I wake up at 5am, workout 530 - 630, read 7-8ish, eat / dick around a bit (usually means a quick game of rocket league), then our preopen call is at 845.

Let your own curiosity take you down a personalized curated rabbit hole. It's like investment ideas. If something doesn't grab your attention right away, chuck it and move on. 

You've got a large backlog as it stands. Make sure what you read is gripping you and you have that ""I can't put this down"" feeling. 

Also -- put dedicated reading time in your schedule. I'm blessed (like others here) where reading is part of the job description. But if its not for you, make it like working out or brushing your teeth. Find 30min-1hour a day for uninterrupted reading time.

There are only a handful of companies that boast such high quality figures with impressive revenue and earnings growth. 

I believe the Apple IDFA change is one of the larger headwinds to ARPU growth. US ARPU growth will likely moderate, and the level could meet somewhere in the middle of current US and Europe ARPU's.

But you’re not going to convince me that ”long term” as other posters are saying, a company that everybody hates, with a product they find annoying (or borderline criminal) that has even been described as, basically, bad for America, and a CEO that appears to stand unwaveringly by these products and tactics is a good one.

People at least liked Bezos and were willing to stick by him for the product and the ethos. That’s basically the opposite of Facebook. And I dont think any Facebook product really stands alone as anything of significance. They’re just another company selling ads, so now you’re going to get a Facebook like button, a Twitter button, a Google button, an Instagram a button and a share with whatsapp button on every page? The internet is too fickle for that to work, especially when people hate the Facebook product and Instagram is free to attack it (for example).


But the real crux of this is that people really don’t like Facebook, and whatever black magic you think suckerberg has, it’s an eyeballs company that nobody wants to look at, an ad company that people fundamentally don’t trust, and it’s trying to be a consumer products company that nobody likes. “Long term” that’s a shitty bet unless something drastically changes, and that thing probably has to be Zuck.";t1_gfupjuh;t3_kd0icb;1607982203.0

The point of creating a *currency* would be portability and acceptability. But if it’s only or mostly used on the FB platform, then those two functions become less important or non existent.

It would literally be easier for them to start/buy a full on bank and issue you a debit card. They could have done that in under a year if they wanted to.

Can we say that for today? Some arguments are for a mild deflation, lower growth. 

Japan had low rates, but then the rest of the world was still growing. Today it's a different narrative and how does the equity investing framework change is what I'm thinking. Maybe the framing of my question is too narrow with focus on equities. 

One of the conversations I had was that rates would lose effectiveness as a signal of cycles. Materials, cost of production, commodities might matter more as zero rates would bite less in the expense structure.

At the beginning of the day, they purchased oil barrels on the TAS market agreeing to pay whatever the price ends up being at 2:30 PM. Their assumption is that the closing price at 2:30 would be much lower than the price at market open. Then throughout the day they would sell oil futures against the barrels they purchased. The futures contracts were sold based on oil price at that moment which as long as it was higher than the predicted price at 2:30, would make them profitable.

On that fateful day, they followed this strategy and made money on futures because the oil price at that time was positive. Then 2:30 hit and the price of oil went negative (and by a much larger amount than anyone thought possible). So they got paid to take the oil barrels.

Instead of being paid for futures and then paying for the oil barrels, they got paid for futures AND got paid for the oil barrels.

But you're right to be sus but not with the macros signals, everyone knew that was going to happen in a sense so it made their job (driving the futures prices down) easier, but the act of flooding the market with short expiration day -> long next expiry futures calendar spreads would drive the price down even more especially with all the liquidity problems. Price ""flash crashed"" because no one was willing to REALLY sell negative oil, but market makers have legal obligations, so they ended up marked super negative for enough time. So, again, like the article says buying TAS and offsetting with short futures: totally legal and legit, but when they mention selling the calendar spreads is where it gets iffy to me.";t1_gfs9ucv;t3_kc8k5l;1607961174.0
gfsbhru;1;"The elephant in the room question is what were the market signals / signs?
“At the start of 2020 the big industrial economies were healthy, investors were optimistic, and West Texas Intermediate was trading at about $60 a barrel. Prices began to fall in February after the first reports of the coronavirus. That accelerated as the outbreak turned into a pandemic. By the end of March, WTI futures were at $20, the lowest they’d been since after Sept. 11. Then, after tense negotiations, the big oil producers—led by Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S.—agreed to reduce production by 10% to try to stabilize prices.”

gfrayl0;7;But from what I read Roomba implied they took delivery on TAS contracts, which they didn't... they shorted futures throughout the day after loading up on the TAS orders, so there was no delivery: the TAS contracts were [offset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offset.asp) by the short futures AND they took out short delta calendar spreads too.;t1_gfqkslc;t3_kc8k5l;1607903955.0
gfrui5x;1;"The ""driving prices down"" thing is illegal, the article talks about it here:

>...His profit is $150,000, the difference  between what he sold oil for (50,000 barrels at prices ranging from $10  to $6, for a total of $400,000) and what he bought it for in TAS  contracts (50,000 barrels at $5 a barrel, or $250,000). All of this is  perfectly legal, *providing the trader* ***doesn’t*** *deliberately try to push  the closing price down* to an artificial level to maximize his profits,  which constitutes market manipulation under U.S. law. Manipulation can  result in civil penalties such as fines or bans, or even criminal  charges

EDIT: and I'm not really trying to say one way or another, it's just gonna be their word that they weren't *trying* drive the price so low with their trades... like their lawyer is saying:

gfs1h7j;5;"It's true that there is a disconnect between past 6 month performance of A shares and B shares, though such situation is not unusual because there is no effective arbitrage channel to close the gap.

That might portend some future gains in the short term, but let me throw some cold water on the thesis of wine in China as a high growth opportunity.

I've had more exposure to Chinese drinking culture than my liver would like. Drinking is an essential part of business and social life there, and there is an established set of drinks and brands that form that tradition. The ""real drinks"" are ""white alcohol"" (baijiu) -- Moutai and a few other brands. Of course, people may be open to trying other things--western liquor, wines, whatnot, and younger people are more likely to do so. But overall, drinking is a social activity which has its established protocol. For wine to *vastly* grow as a market in China, it would have to at least partially supplant baijiu as the social drink of choice. This would be about equivalent to Moutai taking market share away from wine and whisky in the Western world. 

Note that per capita consumption of a particular alcoholic drink is culture-specific and does not by itself signal any potential market share to be gained. Going by the numbers above, United States' wine consumption is 1/4 that of France, but that doesn't mean it's on track to quadruple. Per capita consumption of bourbon in France must be a fraction of that in the US, but I don't believe there is an untapped bourbon market there.

I ran the idea by some of my Chinese friends, two of whom are active investors. Their opinion is an unequivocal ""No, this is not a long-term growth opportunity no matter what famous Western investor believes otherwise"". They basically confirmed what I said above about the ""real drinks"", and pointed out that while Yantai Changyu has been having difficulties ever since Xi started the crackdown, Moutai and other baijiu brands have been steadily growing their top line, and their stock is up 5-10x. This shows who has the moat and who doesn't.";t3_kc31ne;t3_kc31ne;1607918474.0

I don't know the in's and out's of how buying IPv4 addresses as an investment would work, but I would imagine they would hit a peak value before the point that it is no longer cost effective to maintain an IPv4 network. There are an incredibly high number of IPv6 addresses. There are 2\^32 IPv4 addresses (roughly 4.3 billion), but 2\^128 IPv6 addresses, so an incredibly higher number. The internet is built on many technologies which were designed to be used the way they are today, or the vision simply wasn't there for the future we have.

The contract price is based on the ""Nasdaq Veles California Water Index"" which is calculated by reviewing, once per week, transactions in four spot-water markets in California's Central Valley: "" The value of the index reflects the volume-weighted average price of  water, at the source ‒ **excluding conveyance costs** and losses in the  underlying markets after adjusting for idiosyncratic pricing factors  specific to each of the eligible markets and transaction types."" (emphasis added)

I suppose my question is: how correlated in supply and demand in other aquifers to the ones in central California? Because if it's uncorrelated, how would this contract help a farmer in Iowa, for instance?

gfclugh;95;"Nestle is known for striking amazing water rights deals with governments in water deprived regions (potentially illegally and/or through bribery).

Here’s a recent example in California that’s currently in a long-term drought:
“Though it’s on federal land, the Swiss bottled water giant paid the US Forest Service and state practically nothing, and it profited handsomely: Nestlé Waters’ 2018 worldwide sales exceeded $7.8bn.

Conservationists say some creek beds in the area are now bone dry and once-gushing springs have been reduced to mere trickles. The Forest Service recently determined Nestlé’s activities left Strawberry Creek “impaired” while “the current water extraction is drying up surface water resources”.

Meanwhile, the state is investigating whether Nestlé is illegally drawing from Strawberry Creek and in 2017 advised it to “immediately cease any unauthorized diversions”. Still, a year later, the Forest Service approved a new five-year permit that allows Nestlé to continue using federal land to extract water, a decision critics say defies common sense.”

I thought what really convinced him to join in partnership with me was how cheap I was when buying the used typewriter (which I still have) he felt that if I was that careful with money, I would take care of his.

More automation. You want EV exposure. So create an ETF that adds in U.S. EV companies, no China EV companies, no SPAC companies, some battery manufacturers, a lithium miner, and auto add any company that goes public that fits these criteria. Perhaps having an auto kick selection that removes a company from your ETF.

Better re-balancing. Set a min and max % in the ETF for a company or sector. They set an overall % of your portfolio for this ETF. Combine it with partial shares and zero commissions and this can really be finely tuned.";t3_k9ra4m;t3_k9ra4m;1607535378.0

1. Whole foods is complementary to the Amazon business. Groceries were/are a tiny tiny portion of Amazon revenue. Whole foods helps them expand into this new market. Both services will exist together for a long time. Compare that to acquiring a legacy auto maker that makes a product that Tesla is literally making obsolete.

2. Whole Foods was a much smaller company than Amazon, with 10% of Amazon’s revenue and less than 20% of its employees. Compare that to Tesla acquiring a legacy auto maker, it’s basically the reverse. Tesla will be buying a company with four or five times as many employees, much more revenue and costs, etc. Probably not great for controlling your balance sheet to take on so much risk.";t1_gf4uyvf;t3_k9eos2;1607487719.0

Having said that - and I think you’d agree with me here - reading history is instructive of certain tendencies in human nature.

gf17kkx;2;So I’m no expert on this topic but I’ve actually given this (or at least part of this) some thought before. Specifically, I was trying to quantify a short squeeze for any given security to potentially capitalize on any funds flow predictability that maybe could be gleaned. My thought was to take a time series of short interest in any given stock and use the period over period increase in short volume as a proxy for estimating the # of shorts at a certain price (could just take the avg price or vwap over whatever period your measuring the short interest delta over). This is obv imperfect since there will be overlap in people closing out shorts and entering new shorts in any quoted short interest volumes, but my logic is that if you do it over a long enough time horizon, since all shares hypothetically start with 0 short interest, the delta can only materially increase over the LT and assuming the float generally increases over time (which is typical over long periods), your short interest should also proportionally grow over time. So yeah, do this for a long enough period to get a “weighted avg short price” for any given historical period (Nasdaq publishes reports twice a month so those are prob the best stocks to do this on). Then check how short interest changes pre- and post-rally of a stock’s price. Do this for a couple historical periods (ideally ones where your stock rally $ chng vs weighted avg short $ is similar) and I think you could back into a rough % the stock price has to rally to have the shorts cover (or at least are likely to cover within w/e probably distribution the historical periods give you). Obviously I think the % stat would be stock-specific since you’re basically shock testing the investors’ liquidity and risk management approaches, both of which I doubt will be very homogeneous across diff issues. There are prob way better ways of doing this and I’m not even sure this addressed your question, but even if not maybe someone can chime in for my own edification to tell me what obvious thing I’m overlooking.;t3_k8sll7;t3_k8sll7;1607412140.0

gf0ka6b;1;"Okay - I see. Thanks for the straight forward response.

If I understand you right, you're saying biweekly data isn't enough to identify it. What about for past situations? Is that enough information to look at history, or again, do you really benefit from daily data so you can see daily price movements against buying/shorting activity?

Regarding their liquidity - one area I've lacked data is how many shares are available to short with across the major brokers. I only get data on my own broker for example.

gezeh2a;39;"We own a marketing agency that's been using Fiverr to source freelancers since '17. We spend \~30k/year on the platform but have over time moved off of it. As someone who would be in the category of their large LTV customers, I'm not as bullish as you are on their business model for a few reasons.

&#x200B.

Fiverr's primary purpose for a new customer is product discovery. Customers big and small use Fiverr to find service/product providers because Fiverr does a good job at organizing product category, helping upcoming sellers build up reputation, and helping buyers find the good ones vs the bad. The problem is once you've found a good seller, you're tempted to move off the platform because Fiverr takes a very heavy cut out of each transaction. For a $5 service, Fiverr charges the buyer $2 service fee, and $1 to the seller. So the buyer end up paying $7 and the seller only gets $4. This scales up to the more expensive services that sellers provide as well (albeit, at a lower transaction fee percentage). So the challenge for any buyer that has already found their preferred seller is that at that point, Fiverr effectively becomes a rent seeker providing no more value. Why buy through Fiverr when you can just buy it at the seller's own website for 30% less? Fiverr has tried aggressively to combat this by banning buyer/sellers that try to communicate off the platform, which to me, just proves this is a leaky faucet that won't stop until they fix the issue. And the worst part is, the larger customers are more inclined to pursue buying off of Fiverr because they're the ones that'll benefit the most from buying from the sellers own site. So Fiverr effectively churns away their most valuable customers. 

&#x200B.

This is a common problem in many two way market places. Upwork has similar issues but have done a better job at overcoming this rent seeking dilemma for long term buyer/sellers by providing more value in the middle like project management tools for buyer/sellers (i.e., project tracking, expense management, etc). Fiverr on the otherhand, has very poorly in this regard. The last I checked they were focused on going upmarket (the right thing to do), but it seems they were trying to achieve doing this by expending into more categories and encouraging sellers to offer more expensive services. I believe they're missing the core problem and this doesn't and won't change the dilemma mentioned above

&#x200B.

This isn't to say Fiverr won't solve this problem but it's likely not a 2-3 quarter wait. As a more minor note, Fiverr in my view, is already a household name in the world of micro freelancers and I'm not sure how effective their marketing dollars will actually be in terms of customer LTV/CAC on the marginal customer add. 

&#x200B.

I'd imagine Fiverr shareholders would question the platform's usefulness when you can  Google a few of their Top Rated Sellers and find that these sellers also setup websites offering the exact same services for a lower price for their bigger buyers.

gew2lon;14;"Value was ""dead"" for the past year since value investing requires a bullish economic picture and reflationary conditions. We've had the opposite with negative real yields and COVID. With the recent developments on the vaccine front and a rebound in the economy/ reflation, we saw the 15 sigma growth to value rotation.

I completely disagree with most of the article, but the point on cost reduction is worth addressing:

***Cost-Reduction:*** *A lower price has often been associated with inferior products in the past. However, through technology, companies are figuring out ways to deliver better products at a cheaper price than incumbent businesses. Additionally, they are also figuring out ways to reduce the cost of their products throughout the company lifetime. With reduced costs comes mass adoption. For example, while the computer was not accessible to most common people in the 1970s and 1980s, the costs were eventually reduced enough to the point where everyone has a computer or laptop today. Similarly, even if a company has highly-priced products today, investors should ask “can this company continue to reduce price enough to hit mass adoption one day?” For example, one industry that seems ripe for mass adoption in the future is space exploration.*

Costs are just one of part of the demand picture. Mass adoption can occur even at higher price points when customers perceive the product delivers higher value than its peers. When the iPhone was first launched it offered far more incremental value in terms of usability and features than its lower priced competitors. Customers were willing to pay more for what they perceived was greater value, thus leading to iPhone's overwhelming market share dominance in the subsequent years. At the time if Apple had undercut its competitors and reduced the features of its flagship product, it would never have been able to take over the market as it did. Moreover, you should never invest in an industry that is engaging in major price wars with its competitors. A company doing this is not value, but **junk**, as its product at this point has been commoditized and its margins are going to crater. This is characteristic of legacy industries that feature oligopolies, that offer nothing in the way of growth.";t3_k84x4n;t3_k84x4n;1607299627.0

Graham commented on those other measures but that was also a time when bonds had an appreciable yield so you could discount a company's future earnings more because they carried extra risk.

These idiots saying value investing is dead makes me nervous for the day that we realize the price points of some of these growth stocks will never manifest in actual returns for long-term holders.

However, the company has and continues to reduce prices and the car will soon reach the point where it’ll be cheaper than legacy names. Not saying Tesla is a value investment right now, but it’s worth considering because if that was ur reason for not investing in Tesla then u missed out on massive gains. Another current example I see on the market right now is Butterfly Network. Right now their tech is very expensive and just not accessible to the common consumer, but I think price reduction and massive adoption is something they are going to hit in the future.

First, the flair confuses me. I thought it meant “short thesis” as in this company should be shorted. 

Anyway some thoughts below.

Tariffs. Are these really an issue if anyone besides Trump is president? I feel like most ppl know the value of free trade 

The share is up 50% YTD so I don’t feel like it’s totally ignored. 

Something clear happened in 2019 to put the shares in the doghouse - my guess is growth rates declined. I guess that leads to a question about competition- who controls the other 46% of the robotic vacuum market and how are they doing?

I also looked a bit more into it, and at first glance it does seem like an interesting case. The recent quarterly report seems quite strong, however it looks like a big sell off after earnings and then another big sell off on vaccine news (I guess others see it as a covid play too), and the stock has not recovered. 

PE ratio generally seems low as well. I looked a bit online and didn’t see much analyst coverage so it could also be that it’s just not that sexy to investors and doesn’t currently have a lot of interest or coverage? Could present a decent opportunity";t3_k77n62;t3_k77n62;1607176115.0

I do have a quick question regarding this specific statement.

>For the 9 months ended 9/30/20, Online Gaming revenue totaled $239M, up 30% YoY from $184M in the same prior year period. Keep in mind, that this is an increase that happened during a COVID-19 global pandemic that delayed and shortened many professional sports seasons.

I understand that COVID had a huge impact on the sports industry. However can't that be precisely why the revenue has increased so dramatically YoY. COVID has limited people from engaging in their daily hobbies and other leisurely activities, and watching sports games and placing bets are one of the activitives that can be safely done at home with phones and laptops. So I'm worried when this is all over, Online Gaming, which still takes up a huge proportion of the company's revenue, would not be able to grow at such a high rate.

Energy adoption especially is notoriously slow with major transitions in history taking around 50 years from one energy source to another. Vaclav Smil did an excellent job describing this with more detail in his book, Energy and Civilization. Essentially, any transition, such as from burning wood to coal, or getting electricity, or the use of natural gas, all take about 50 years. I think humans would desire to see changes happen more quickly due to the climate, and maybe they will, but history shows that it takes a long time for various reasons (think of how much supporting industry, technological advancement, distribution infrastructure, etc. is needed along the way). I'm not one to stand in the way of technological progress, but I'm a little cautious on how quickly some expect it to occur at this time.

I think there are a lot of examples of technology impact and adoption. The internet for example was a major improvement in the flow of information. Someone really interested in economic impacts could have studied the mail system, Telegraph, telephone, and more.

A historian could easily benchmark the start of the current transition to renewables from the day photovoltaics were discovered. 

The obvious exponential decline in the cost of renewable generation and electricity storage makes it fairly easy to predict the adoption curve of renewables. As a materials chemist I see no technological barrier to the rapid growth of renewable energy adoption.

And today, investment funds don't even hide their actions, they label it as a momentum factor and sell it to investors as a legitimate part of their portfolio. It can all change when it slows or even the slightest hiccup occurs in the markets. 

There are times where I just don't understand why the world gets so removed from the basics and fundamentals of what they are doing. 

The radical issues going on today could have unknown consequences and it drives me crazy. In 1998, Long Term Capital Management took hits due to a Russian debt default, then lost hundreds of millions on an acquisition arbitrage, and then spreads widened and threw off all their other ""convergence trades"" as they called them. Who could have even come up with those things to take down a big fund? It didn't stop the dot-com bubble either.

The amount of movements going on today with tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, questionable accounting (""Adjusted EBITDA""), questionable auditing (emerging markets), record high catastrophe bond issuance, and more is just driving me crazy. And you get so called pundits like Ark that manage tons of money and then go on CNBC to express their views. You get others who talk about how ""the floor"" of Bitcoin is at some level. None of them has real rationale.

I'm sorry for the rant, but I can't help but think that it's any day now that we'll get some kind of correction. I've been invested for 13+ years in a concentrated portfolio (usually no more than 3-4 names, sometimes less) and as a result of where I see market prices and risks, I'm majority in cash. I'm patient with opportunities to invest, but I get concerned about the impacts to the world and economy if there is too large of a dislocation because of all of this tinder that's building up in the forest.

Again - sorry for the rant, but Ark is one of these firms that is so far removed from fundamentals that I just cringe at how many are big supporters. I know it's human nature, but depending on what goes wrong, it could be bad for the world. I shouldn't take these risks too seriously though... there's always many risks and sometimes it can take years to play out. I recently took a look at the data from early 2005 regarding mortgage delinquencies, movement in the USD, etc. and it was a very precarious situation. It wasn't until 2008/2009 that things would actually fall apart though. I think you can identify things early and even if you're right, you have no clue when it'll turn or exactly why. 

In general, and this is a rant, but I don't think people are properly acknowledging the real risks that always exist in the market.

gekjla3;5;"People who say that are being ambiguous. Liquidity usually refers to a cash crisis where people are forced to sell assets for too cheap (according to gov central planners oracle of asset price correct values) to resolve a short-term cash crunch. That was the March scenerio where everyone was being margined and the price of dollars was skyrocketing (hence the fall of asset prices) as people were trying to raise cash.

What the Fed does in these instances is print up money. This has the effect of devaluing the dollar in relation to assets and allows people to find the cash needed to cover their cash based liabilities (debt, margin, etc) without creating a chain of default events.

**When people (economists) refer to QE draining liquidity that is NOT referring to cash**. That is instead referring to the opposite: *assets*. Instead of the ability to acquire cash it is referring to the ability to acquire assets specifically high quality assets. QE is literally creating an asset shortage (hence liquidity crisis). This is because the Fed already owns 7%+ of all US financial assets. It did this by printing cash and removing assets from the financial system. Now the cash / asset balance is such that there is a shortage of assets. Hence the rise in asset prices. And it owns something like 25% of high quality assets.

The problem from some people's perspective is the specific asset it is draining from the system. It is draining no-risk fixed income products (treasuries) from the financial system. The result is *high quality assets are disappearing*. The only thing left are lower quality assets. The end result of this is sky high bond prices (hence low yields) and people speculating on super high-risk assets. This is how it moves people up the risk-curve because it literals removes any low-risk assets from the financial system. That is the liquidity crisis of QE that people refer to. Hence, there are two separate liquidity crisis people talk about, but which one they mean is ambiguous";t1_gekeo20;t3_k5ylpb;1607063263.0

gejip09;4;"One of the questions I've been wrestling with is how to get comfortable with the assumptions you plug into your model.  Professor Damodaran's valuation definitely *feels* plausible to me. And to dissect why, it's because he contextualizes his assumptions. Examples:

* Airbnb functions less like a intermediary than a hotel so it makes more sense to compare them to Expedia and [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) so Airbnb's Operating Margins is assumed to be between [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and Expedia's Operating Margin
* Gross booking of 150 Billion in the future because expedia already has 107 Billion. Growth rate in gross booking decreasing to 25% from much higher because the base is getting bigger.

From digesting his valuation, it seems to me that even with the context/benchmarks, picking an input is really just a gut feel. He could have put gross bookings at 130 Billion with the same rationale  and it still might come off *feeling* plausible.

When he did the Monte Carlo Simulation, I didn't really follow why he skewed the Operating Margin that way. Maybe it lined up with his story more and just skewed it that way based on gut feel?

The thing is the policy is violated frequently but there  is no data available from AirBnb to identify who is hosting and how much.

Leave the algorithm playing for a little while and it's able to understand the objective of the game and come up with winning strategies, completely from the raw pixel data alone and self-play.

It was able to do this with nearly *60 different games* that are very different from each other, and perform better than top human players in almost all of them.

gek9r83;3;"I think the protein folding of Deepmind shows a couple of different things about the AI race for companies. I think first the performance of which these models are growing might be about 4x-10x every 2 years, way above Moore's laws. The reason being is that the models aren't limited by CPU cycles like Moore's law, they are limited by how well can training be parallelized on the cloud, and how much money someone is willing to spend to train a model. The first initial breakthrough in deep learning, AlexNet, was able to use parallel GPU cycles, and took 6 days to train. I imagine the total cost for something like this couldn't be more than $5000 dollars.  Recently a deep learning breakthrough in NLP, GPT-3, costed about 5 million dollars to train. I think in the future this trend is only going to continue, and I really don't see why things thought of as previously impossible, could become possible after 10 years, and AI could be 100000x better than what it is today. I mean if in 2030 Google could spend $5Billion dollars on a training for an AI that could be 1000x better than GPT 3 that could code a better google, why wouldn't they do it? 

I think in order to win ML, you need a mix of talent to setting up the training to fit to the problem you need, and brute force amount of money to spend on training. If it is the case that whoever has the talent, and will to spends the most money will win the AI game, then GOOGL seems the most poised to take it all. The only other companies I can see possibly beating them is AMZN, or MSFT/OpenAI, but they would need to reinvest there money into AI, and hope that technical challenges of setting up the training become way easier.

To create new medication, in a lot of cases, the chemicals in the medication need to bind to a certain protein. Think of the protein as a lock, and the medication as a key that fits into the lock. The first step in doing this is to actually figure out the shape of the lock (protein), so that you can start to create a key for it. Turns out this is notoriously difficult, and can be compared to finding a needle in a very large haystack. This is part of the reason why it takes so long and costs so much money to produce new medications. AlphaFold potentially makes this process 10x more efficient -- the research states that AlphaFold's predictions match researchers' output with an accuracy between 87-92%. No other algorithm even comes close. This means that pharma companies could license the technology and use the output from AlphaFold as a baseline from which they can accelerate the process of figuring out the shape of the protein.";t1_geiausz;t3_k5uelu;1607021058.0

This is what I was replying to, and they were completely wrong with it, hence my explanation. There is damn near no revenue involved in university research. And outside of straight computer work, there is generally a lot of maintenance and equipment required for primary research. Repeating experiments often require using new equipment/reagents/builds/whatever depending on subject of research. The research dept pays for all of that as well as what it takes to have the researchers to begin with. The research dept won't be getting anything out of the end result as it's either funded by private party who already paid for it or by university who won't be paying them additional for it.

> But let’s take a step back and ask…does it even matter? Unless all you are doing is buying S&P 500 Index funds, my opinion is you really shouldn’t care about the overall market level. And if you ARE buying index funds, you should probably just be dollar-cost-averaging anyways, so it should matter even less to you.

I disagree. The market provides a crude benchmark to compare yourself against. Investing is time intensive and requires a good degree of skill. Life is already short enough and getting good at something takes time, so knowing how well you perform compared to if you had just passively invested is useful, at least if one looks at their time from a Pareto principle. I'm quite new to investing but I've decided if i can't outperform the markets over the next 10 years I'll switch to a more passive form of investing.

> One common thing I hear these days to justify these valuations is that we are not currently in a Tech Bubble like the 2000 Tech Bubble, because in the 2000 Tech Bubble you had a lot of unprofitable companies and “concept” companies that were going up, and in the current market all the companies that are “expensive” are highly profitable, market share leaders with lucrative business models. To me, this seems to be maliciously misleading. First of all, the true “apples-to-apples” comparison would be to compare current large cap, profitable winners like Apple, Google, and Facebook to previous large cap profitable winners like Microsoft, Lucent, Intel, Cisco, etc.

In some sense yes. In any ""boom"" there are companies that are obviously incompetent (like Nikola). At the same time, from the 2000's boom did come a handful of extremely valuable and profitable companies (Google, Apple, Amazon) which at the time were not these ultra big monopolistic companies that they are today. In any boom there will be a number of strong companies that will be good picks because of strong fundamentals as well as a bunch that go bust. Then it becomes a question of how do we identify these good companies? I'm currently reading Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, and in the forward, Fishers son states that back testing the fifteen points would've eliminated every bad company during the internet boom. I don't know if this would work today but it provides a starting point. 

>Not only would the fifteen points have easily eliminated all scandal stocks of the 2000–2002 bear market, they would have also eliminated all the so-called 95 percent club—the tech stocks that lost 95 percent or more of their value during the bear market because they were internet pipe­ dreams,  or  whatever,  with  basically  1999  hype  but  nothing  real  there. Think of how many internet stocks had no real sales force (and certainly none to intimidate a competitor), and no profit margin at all, and  no  plan  to  achieve  profitability  much  less  improve  it,  and  no  fundamental  research,  and  no  ability  to  exist  without  future  equity  financing. They couldn’t have made it on half the fifteen points. Then, too, the fifteen points by exclusion would have eliminated quite  a  lot  of  other  companies.  But  think  of  the  firms  of  the  prior  decades that the fifteen points would not have eliminated. They would have  hooked  you  into  real  firms,  whether  cheap  or  expensive,  and  would have allowed you to navigate the tricky currents of financial mar­ket  volatility  whether  your  own  personal  inclinations  were  toward  growth stocks or value stocks, small stocks or big on

A market is not a place where assets are valued. It is a place where the amount of free capital in a system is determined. You believe the price of a stock is a reflection of the company and it isn't it is a reflection of the cash available to be traded for it.  


What we are seeing is not that US companies are worth more but that there is more money trying to get at the shares of those companies. There are various reasons, the rise in wealth around the world, the lowering of other venues for speculation, the printing of money, etc.   


Companies are just stacks of cash stapled to a baseball card. You can value the stack of cash or the baseball card, or combine them in some way. But, regardless, in a competitive market what price someone pays is directly died to the total amount of free cash to be spent.  


""Stocks like NIO, Palantir (which I wrote about), Snowflake, Shopify, etc. are skyrocketing based on far off projections of growth and profitability.""   


No. Those stocks are not moving because of valuations. They are moving because of constricted liquidity. To continue my metaphor, those stocks are LeBron James cards in a market that doesn't realize there is a warehouse full of LeBron James cards yet to be discovered.  


In the ""long run"" the market is a grave. All stocks die. And, all companies die. Use factset to find the average 5 year return for the largest cap stocks over the last 100 years and then compare them to the average return for the smallest 20%. Then extend that time period.

The economic value-add case for individual companies can seem plausible when you look at each individually, but it may look like more and more of a clown show when looking at the entire system. All of these data companies are definitely adding a lot of value... but I think the total dollar value-add implication over the next 10-20 years (however many billions or trillions) seems ridiculous, when you consider what they are actually doing for society and the economic value-add. The biggest potential value add to the world, in the future, is the holy grail of AGI (artificial general intelligence), which Google is a leader in, yet trades relatively modestly.

Thinking about what changed today vs 2019, for many of these tech companies to rise in valuation... just interest rates? And what if interest rates ever go up? Then the valuation collapses?

One of your valuation methods used firms like Hershey, Kraft Heinz, etc., which I don't expect have a long term volume decline. But similar to Marlboro, I suspect they all benefit from their established brand position. Due to the declining volume at Altria, is it ""right"" to compare it to those firms?

Second, you made a comment that Altria raises prices and offsets volume decline. Do you know if their generic alternatives also do the same? In effect, is Altria widening the price gap to unbranded cigarettes with each year's price increases? If so, this could be a risk if they are simply asking for too much of a premium over generics?

gedeg14;10;"Thanks for the reply, and i enjoy a good spirited conversation so no need for apologies! 

1) My point about not caring about general market levels is that if individual investors are DCA'ing into the index, than they should stay the course no matter what the valuations are, because you can't predict the market. If you are a stock picker, than overall market level also shouldn't matter to you, since you just need to find a few mispriced opportunities. Whether or not you should measure yourself against the S&P 500 (or any other index) is another matter. I agree generally with your point that you should see if you are beating the benchmark or not to determine whether stock-picking is worth all the time it requires.

2) Even if a company is promising, paying a horrendous multiple is going to destroy your forward returns. It's true that the last bubble contained some ""winners"" like Amazon. In 2000 amazon had 2.7bn in sales and 350m shares outstanding for $7.70/share of sales. Paying 100x P/S means you would have paid $770, and with the current price at $3220, you would have made a 7.4% CAGR over the next 20 years. The point being that right now a diligent investor  may correctly find ""the next Amazon"", but paying some of the multiples we are seeing will give them a substandard return. The key (which plays into your point) is whether you can find the next AMZN, GOOGL, etc *and still pay a reasonable price*. Personally, I think there is too much emphasis on investors trying to pick ""ultra-winners"" like FANMAG stocks, when they are very hard to identify early. I think most people would do better if they stuck with boring companies in non-disruptive industries that had sound capital deployment prospects and a long runway for mid-single-digit growth. Those are much easier to identify and rarely get extremely overpriced (although you do see some froth even with these companies in our current market)

I think the combination of low interest rates and elimination of returns in fixed income and other securities has caused the major flows into equities.

gf2106o;1;"Hey thanks for the kind words.

Regarding comparable firms: I used that list because those are the companies listed in Altria's 10-K as comparable firms. I also added a few beer companies, which i thought had similar overall consumption metrics. Tobacco is considered a ""consumer staple"" along with Food, brewers, soft drinks, packaged foods, and household and personal products. It is a repeated purchase that consumers make and most would consider it on par with something like groceries/gasoline, especially considering the location of tobacco purchases (grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations). So i believe it is the correct group for comparison. To your point about volume declines, you are right that those comparable companies perhaps don't have the magnitude of volume decline that Tobacco does, but I would argue that certain subsegments like Soda do indeed have future volume pressure similar to Cigaretes, especially in the US. Also, Oral tobacco, Cigars, and Vaping (at least before the vape ban) are actually seeing sustained volume increases. The only reason aggregate Altria sales are down is because the size of the cigarette business is so large relative to the other segments which are growing. If we fast forward say 50 years, I can imagine a future where vaping replaces cigarettes entirely, and you see volume growth on par with global population growth (nicotine by itself has no known long-term health consequences, which makes vaping akin to caffeine use). So given all that, I think it is fair to compare it to those companies but perhaps discount the multiple somewhat for the lack of sales growth. However, i could argue that free cash flow growth per share is ultimately what matters to shareholders, and Altria will continue to do well on that metric despite volume pressure.

On price increases, Altria does raise prices on all brands (there is a chart in my original write up that shows this, its the 4th chart in the Smokeable products section of the blog post). So there isn't an ever-growing gap between the products in terms of price.";t1_gf1yzyf;t3_k4ykwq;1607438254.0

I personally don't try to find these crazy companies and i'm most certainly not willing to pay a premium for them. Margin of safety plays a real role in my investments and as of now the only overvalued stock I hold is alteryx, because i believe they have enormous potential as a growth stock moving forward. (I also hold OMAB, Altria (based on your report!) Facebook, questor technology and Pfizer and MTY, but i intend to sell MTY soon). 

Again, i'm very new to this, i've only started a few months ago, but one hypothesis that seems to work for me so far is to find companies which are tied to an industry rather than investing directly in that industry. (Airports instead of airplanes, drilling/energy companies instead of oil companies etc).

On a different note, I'm actually shocked to see the amount of speculation and rather low quality investment advice on reddit. I find the approach espoused by WSB or by certain people on r/investing or r/stocks to be repulsive. I'm glad to see your report as a push back against some of this insanity. Thanks for getting back to me, i hope to see more of your work in the future.

My biggest struggle, even after completing this exercise, is that if you identify a truly good business, it is very hard to gauge whether you should buy it even if it is ""slightly"" overpriced. I still struggle with ""paying up"" for quality, even though I own some high quality stocks, because I like to have a margin of safety (as you've mentioned). I try to layer conservative assumptions with a conservative entry multiple to minimize my downside. This clip from Alice Schroeder explains it better than I can.

If you're looking for value, i would recommend doing some research on large cap Defense stocks (NOC, RTX, LMT, LHX, avoid GD). Some industrials like NVR, WAT and Tobacco of course (MO, PM, BTI). If you are looking at energy i'd recommend Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL), go read Horizon Kinetics letters on them to understand why they are the best business model in the Oil space.

I'll probably make a blog post about all of those stocks at some point.

You have the mindset of a long-term professional, don't get sucked in by this widespread FOMO/Momentum euphoria, it is contagious! You are correct about how bad the reddit boards have become. It's borderline boiler room level at this point. I see almost no real due diligence, very flimsy rationale, etc. What i've noticed is that anything that is high quality tends to go unnoticed and garner few upvotes, while low-quality posts get upvoted like crazy because it generates big confirmation bias amongst the reddit committee.

gedkf0e;2;"I mean... most of it, or I would have done a deeper point by point analysis. It misses the Mark on what an SoC is, as well as its performance advantages (such that they are) and the reason it is a popular package these days. It suggests Intel can’t do this, or that M1 is superior or has a huge advantage because it has an integrated package and x86 has first no SoC implementations... then it goes on to list some. Then it ignores that AMD owns ATI when discussing their SoC design churches.

It vastly overstates the importance of ooo, and at some points kind of confuses it with hyperthreading which is weird to do, since that’s an Intel only extension.

The fact is that simply nothing about x86 makes it inherently faster. It’s years of development, r&d expenditures, and the being designed for a specific class of device that has driven performance gains. Atom, for example, was a very low power chipset that was quite fast for what it was, when it was introduced. People didn’t want to pay Intel prices (similar to here) to use it in cheap smartphones, so it never found a huge market. Doesn’t mean x86 couldn’t have driven the atom line very far with different design goals and adequate time.

And I don’t know where to start on “designed for a specific purpose” and therefore faster. Although the author then proceeds to write an article describing why he thinks ARM is better suited for general computing (while totally ignoring any importance of the fact that Apple’s GPU performance is guaranteed to be problematic for some time to come. So I don’t think he knows either lol

He spends a couple pages talking about developing software whilst ignoring that the languages are going to be the same and all that changes is the compiler. If Apple does it’s job well, all that will happen is developers will go click a button that says “build for Apple ARM” and XCode will do the rest. Same code, different architecture, 100% transparent. That’s not likely to happen (it would be magic) but that is the goal.

If Apple can pull a quality GPU out of its ass in the next year or two THAT would be impressive. But the whole argument for an ARM based product line is a no -starter if they don’t have graphics chipsets to rival ATI NVIDIA or even Intel. Doesn’t discuss the importance of this. It’s one of the reasons ARM hasn’t seen wider adoption for machines that need generally good performance in desktop computing.

So again it’s hard for me to deep dive it, and I realize that’s pretty superficial explanation and I haven’t addressed all of his points. Because it’s just not accurate in either it’s explanation of how the chips work or it’s description of why that’s better.

If he means Intel tried to put x86 in to toothbrushes, phones, laptops, desktops and data centers and that had a bad influence on its roadmap from which they have had difficulty recovering. Then yeah, maybe I’d buy that. But that’s not what he says. He says ARM is a superior architecture that only one company has noticed its potential and x86 is fundamentally unable to compete with its design. And that’s just not true.

If this article was the full and true story, why isn’t Apple switching back TO to PPC, which it helped design? Apple also helped create ARM. For one purpose. POWER for another.

If Apple had an x86 license, I would wager they would be trying to design competing x86 chips and not switching architectures. There were rumblings of them buying AMD for that purpose a while ago... until AMD’s x86 designs started to perform better and their business regained some ground. Oh, by the way, that happened after AMD poached people from Apple... just saying.

So the transition is driven by apple’s desire to iPhoneify their desktops and to drive up margins (which is a perfectly valid Waylon confront what many are worried is a brick wall in terms of market penetration and upgrade cycle). The product lines are converging and the architecture is too. That sort of makes sense. But apple does not have the secret tech sauce that is going to bury Intel. They DO have the secret financial engineering sauce that can support a 1T+ valuation for the next 6 months or whatever. Very few people in the general public are paying attention to the financial reasons.

Apple is spending the money it used to give to Intel for R&D on its own intellectual property now. There will be cost savings but no price reductions. It’s upgrade cycle will change to better suit its marketing needs. It’s design hurdle was literally “don’t suck” and they delivered a machine that didn’t suck, although it does have limited applications, and I have to think his low end MacBook or Mac mini beats $4000Mac Pro is total bullshit. The new M1 doesn’t suck.

If you buy it, and use your laptop as a general computing/office machine (no graphics no VMs no cross platform development since it can’t compile for x86) then you will be equally happy and apple will make more money than if the machine had an Intel chip in it.";t1_gec9w49;t3_k4i3an;1606922487.0
geay6iw;2;"Oh I see.  NSObject for the uninformed under the hood is a thread safe hash table, so it's pretty complicated.  It's not a normal RC object or a normal ARC (atomic reference counted) object.  So pulling this apart gets a bit more complicated:

The three slow downs in NSObject are: 1) memory allocation 2) indirection 3) locks (threaded code)

edit: Some more information about it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4713533/is-nsobjects-retain-method-atomic

Any of those three could be responsible for the speed up, or any combination of the three.  At first glance it's probably an speed increase in memory allocation, but who knows maybe it was speeding up threading synchronization.

btw, a pure RC object is super simple.  It's got a count variable in it, to keep track of how many owners it has (how many parts of code are using it).  When a new owner pops up the count gets incremented and when an owner disappears the count gets decremented.  When the count hits 0 it deletes itself.  Increment and decrement are two of the some of the highest optimized instructions in assembly.  Getting any more speed than you normally would for those instructions is going to be near impossible.  Getting more speed out of synchronizing threaded code, on the other hand, is theoretically very much possible.";t1_gealsdm;t3_k4i3an;1606859737.0

With a RISC architecture, you mean, right? Because OP's article already goes into quite some detail as to why, quote: ""Intel and AMD may not be able to catch up."" (with x86-64).

It has to do with Out-of-Order execution (OoO).

>The biggest baddest Intel and AMD microprocessor cores have 4 decoders, which means they can decode 4 instructions in parallel spitting out micro-ops.

>But Apple has a crazy 8 decoders. Not only that but the ROB is something like 3x larger. You can basically hold 3x as many instructions. No other mainstream chip maker has that many decoders in their CPUs.

>Why Can’t Intel and AMD Add More Instruction Decoders?

>This is where we finally see the revenge of RISC, and where the fact that the M1 Firestorm core has an ARM RISC architecture begins to matter.

>You see, for x86 an instruction can be anywhere from 1–15 bytes long. On a RISC chip instructions are fixed size. Why is that relevant in this case?

>Because splitting up a stream of bytes into instructions to feed into 8 different decoders in parallel becomes trivial if every instruction has the same length.

>However on an x86 CPU the decoders have no clue where the next instruction starts. It has to actually analyze each instruction in order to see how long it is.

>The brute force way Intel and AMD deal with this is by simply attempting to decode instructions at every posssible starting points. That means we have to deal with lots of wrong guesses and mistakes which has to be discarded. This creates such a convoluted and complicated decoder stage, that it is really hard to add more decoders. But for Apple it is trivial in comparison to keep adding more.

>In fact adding more causes so many other problems that 4 decoders according to AMD itself is basically an upper limit for how far they can go.

it's not really a new concept. back in the 90's they used to sell cheap hard drives to the consumer market and those relied on the CPU just to function and control the flow of data. Geeks would buy SCSI controllers and hard drives with special chips that took over those functions. People I've talked to said they would get performance increases equal to going from a Pentium 2 to 3 or a Pentium 3 to a 4.

I used to have a PC with one of the original sandblaster cards. those things had an IDE port and one time I connected my CD drive to it. My load times for some games were cut by half or more and frames increased too. this one space flight sim I played used to be really slow on my original PC and then became like a real flight sim and too fast to play after I bought a sandblaster card. reason being the sandblaster card also had a controller chip that took over some functions from the CPU and freed up CPU cycles for stuff that mattered 

the way the PC has been designed for the last 30 some years results in a lot of essentially junk data being created and processed. my guess is that it's close to 20% or 30% of total data processed. what apple has done is designed a computer that removes the need for this data to be processed and leaves enough resources to process the data that really counts to the end user.";t1_gea21ha;t3_k4i3an;1606845514.0

The modem integration doesn’t really make sense because the baseband is its own little ARM package to begin with. There’s just no advantage in what you describe from a performance standpoint.

It would also rule out using binned desktop processors in iPads, which will probably happen at some point just for cost reasons.

Cramming more stuff on to the same die isn’t necessarily better, unless they are somehow sharing a high speed interconnect/otherwise using shared resources. This does not describe an LTE/5G modem.

I am not saying this will never happen, but it doesn’t “need to” happen, and at least in terms of current hardware I don’t see any advantage. Qualcomm’s decision to do this in their X-series platforms is just as much a factor of giving OEM’s a fully functioning design as it is for speed reasons (e.g. you’re going to buy all your stuff from Qualcomm if it’s all coming on the same piece of silicon). This isn’t a problem for apple because they do all their own integration anyway.

Also, Qualcomms modems are just really good. And everyone uses them, so they are pretty standardized which is important in radio communications. Apple fought a big fat lawsuit to be able to use those modems. They clearly think they have merit.

I’d be interested to see if/how/why there would be power savings to having a modem on die... could be. If there is, maybe Apple will try it. But I’m quite certain it wouldn’t make radio connections faster.";t1_gedujmc;t3_k4i3an;1606954295.0

Never said it was. 

> this does not describe an LTE/5G modem.

This is the only RAT i'm talking about and wasn't trying to say they'll put a cellular modem into the M1s. Size, cost and power aren't in as much of a premium in a PC/laptop as they are in handsets. That being said, cellular integration into their APs is their road map assuming they can actually get their footing in modem tech which I'm skeptical of, at least in the 4-5 year timeframe they've suggested.

I'm not a GPU/CPU guy so I wont pretend to know the trade-offs apple has made but they've demonstrated a pretty strong competence in their mobile APs so i'd give them the benefit of the doubt here. 

>Qualcomm’s decision to do this in their X-series platforms is just as much a factor of giving OEM’s a fully functioning design as it is for speed reasons (e.g. you’re going to buy all your stuff from Qualcomm if it’s all coming on the same piece of silicon)

Qualcomm has been integrating modems into their snapdragon product line for decades. 

>This isn’t a problem for apple because they do all their own integration anyway.

Define integration? Apple buys the MDM, xCeiver and PMICs from Qualcomm because QCOM binds their chipsets. Apple is able to ""integrate"" their front-end of their radios more than most OEMs because of their volume and the fact that Apple insists on doing a world phone instead of regional skus. The radio in iPhones is impressive, but they hardly do their own integration in any greater sense than other major OEMs. 

> Also, Qualcomms modems are just really good. And everyone uses them, so they are pretty standardized which is important in radio communications. Apple fought a big fat lawsuit to be able to use those modems. They clearly think they have merit.

Qualcomm's modem's are the best, no debate there. Not sure what ""pretty standardized"" means? I guess QCOM is the leading cellular modem so being at the cutting edge they get to a louder voice in  3GPP and carrier standards but 4G is baked and there are a lot more players in 5G who want to make sure Qcom's dominance in 3G standards/IP isn't repeated.  

>Apple fought a big fat lawsuit to be able to use those modems. They clearly think they have merit.

This wasn't what the lawsuit was about. Qcom never refused to sell Apple chipsets, Apple refused their licensing requirements because QCOM is the largest expense on an iPhone BOM. Apple thought they'd flex on Qcom like they do everyone else by suing them and pushing anti-trust lawsuits but realized there's no alternative, especially in the 5G space at the moment, and settled. 

>I’d be interested to see if/how/why there would be power savings to having a modem on die... could be.

There's massive power savings and performance gains from putting a modem on die with their AP. Size, cost, power and ease of integration all improve and are all driving specs in handsets.  They tried for years to get Qcom to license their modem for integration and Qcom flatly refused. 

Whether Apple can make a successful 3-5G modem is a whole other question. Many smart companies have tried and many have failed. But there's a clear trend in Apple that owning the design in non-commoditized parts is their goal and the M1 seems to be an example of that.";t1_gefm9w5;t3_k4i3an;1607052677.0

If you look to hedge tail risk then probably you should look at ""units"" (very far OTM puts).  Because you are buying far OTM you only have big indexes as real alternative cause once liquidity dries up you will not get a good price to hedge.

Such a hedge will normally kick in when you have a serious rug pull and can do wonders for your Sharpe ratio, and is relatively cheap: you can throw probably like 0.5% of principal into it but will only matter if you have 20% drop or something.

However volatility now us still pretty high all over the board and hedging now for a deflationary event (like buying puts on SPX/SPY) is very expensive.  Generally with VIX above 20 is expensive to hedge. 

To choose a strike I normally go to something like 0.05-0.1 delta or even lower (and buy a few of them). As for time ... that will depend on what is your scenario that you want to hedge for.  Like for example .. will the stimulus get delayed and they will start doing shit politics ... then probably that will unravel in the next few months and the I will pick +3-4 months out ... so lets say my event will be Feb then I will be looking at May June.

You can hedge also with VIX calls, yet again now everything is expensive. You will want to buy also far OTM calls around $0.5 for VIX.

These ones don't decay like normal options and they are European (can't be exercised early) so you can buy closer to your event date.

Another hedge will be to buy calls on GLD or /GC but this is kinda different than above because if you have a sell-off gold will fall along with everything. However you are betting here that if things get nasty,  then fed/treasury/politicians will throw the towel and  print and when this happens normally gold rebounds fast.  Here you can get closer to ATM and buy leaps (1-2 years). The advantage here is that in current environment GLD tends to drift higher anyway as long interest rates are around zero.  So you can actually make money from you hedge.

TD/DR: my response sort of answers 2 and 3. 


If you’re doing anything value related, there is no need to hedge. If you’re sure that a stock is undervalued, but may take years to realize, then you’re just holding on. Even if the share price dips (for some arbitrary reason, that doesn’t change your thesis), there won’t be any material need to hedge. You may say “what about if you’re wrong?” To which I would respond that if you have a doubt about the undervaluation of the company, make sure to account for it in your valuation. If there are any material changes to the company, reevaluate and either hold or sell. 

If on the other hand you’re making a directional play, or a more short term trade (like within a year), then hedging may have a role. For example, I just read that GM is backing out of their investment in Nikola. they won’t be taking an equity stake or building the trucks. Perhaps if you bought into Nikola under the thesis that they will be a leader in EV semi trucks, but were worried about the viability of the business mode, or the short-report, you could have bought in-the-money puts (at your cost basis say) with an expiry within the year. In theory, your max loss from the hedge would be the price you paid for the puts, while your max gain would be whatever the stock increases by minus the cost of your puts.

I've generally done okay with shorting a basket of stocks I think have poor characteristics (high capital intensity, low returns on investment, low growth) and it's reduced my drawdowns during periods of market turmoil.  I also don't have to pick a time period like in options.

You may also consider put options on corporate credit. Volatility in bonds tends to be very low during normal times and very high in crisis times, so the options are decent trades. If you are an institutional investor, you can also look at CDS on specific corporate bonds.

In March, I had a basket of puts on HYG and shorts on specific equities and I was able to avoid some of the downturn and put money to work. Also worked out pretty well in the downturn in 2018.

I would be careful on hedging using currencies. They are generally uncorrelated, but not inversely correlated. There are times when the correlations may work opposite to the way you think, and interest rates are not always the dominant driver. If you're interested in exchange rates, I would check out Michael Rosenberg's books - great series on fundamental analysis of currencies.

ge6xnkm;1;"This year, I have started hedging my portfolio when I am having concerns using far-OTM puts. They offer the needed 'convexity' in payoff when the market crashes. 

Gold is not very interesting in my opinion, as this does not offer convexity. However, very long duration sovereign bonds can be interesting as a hedge. But how low can interest rates go? This uncertainty is too big of a risk to me. In addition, when interest rates moves in the wrong direction, losses can be large. 

This makes hedging with put options the most interesting hedge to me as a retail investor. Cost is limited to the premium you pay. I use three month options and roll-over after one month to avoid too much theta decay. Furthermore, the put options I buy are around 30% OTM. To limit liquidity risk, I choose the strike price which offers the most liquidity (so not always exactly 30% OTM). 

Selling the puts is most interesting when vix is around 60 to 70%. With vix at a lower level, the convexity in the value of the put is not yet 'fully utilised'. It is difficult to know when to sell the puts exactly, as this will always be a guess whether the market will plummet further.

I prefer using SPY options for liquidity purposes. Of course, this does not offer a perfect hedge when buying other securities, but otherwise, hedging becomes rather burdensome. Some countries tax hedging gains when they are not coming from index-hedges. This is important to keep in mind.

Lastly, I have read about variance swaps. This is not something for retail investors, but it seems to be very interesting for institutional players. However, I do not have experience nor a lot of knowledge about them.

ge5mbbs;2;Generally, I couldn't agree more. I don't like to hedge due to the costs and how often I'm wrong on an outcome. There are times where I do want to explicitly hedge some risks in part as an insurance policy and also to take advantage of situations where the markets might be incorrectly pricing probabilities of certain outcomes.

ge6yn3v;2;"Thank you - that makes a lot of sense and it exactly describes the issues I faced such as nearly no liquidity further out and far out of the money puts. The issues with the VIX and GLD are also exactly my situation. Gold is weird, because it should follow market sentiment (if it's a sudden move as you describe) and all the more now given how much is in ETFs.

Your point on the use of indexes makes sense. I've taken a look and it seems like the big one, Nasdaq 100 and others, have a decent amount of activity. When I look even deeper at smaller indexes (factor ETFs, etc.), that's where it dries up yet again. It seems like the choice might come down to either picking something with more options volume that allows me to create a hedge or pick a bigger index?

I don't think I ever realized how shallow the options market is unless you're trying to use the nearest expiration. And I might consider shorter term hedges that I have to roll over. It's becomes a little more of a time consumption, but could be the better choice so I have more to pick from.

ge8259t;2;"> I think you have to define first if you’re hedging a leveraged or unleveraged portfolio and if leveraged what type of Margin you’re using

Okay - so actually, no outright concerns in that regard. My portfolio is highly conservative by standard measures (to simplify this discussion) at nearly 80% cash, no debt in my life, etc.

This is not normally how I run the portfolio, but I can't find good deals. I built up my portfolio over the years finding good deals every few years and it's worked so far, about 12-13 years of investing. I'm very strict in that if I don't find a good deal, I'll let the portfolio shift to cash. It's my own money so there's no hurry. I'd rather be patient and fall behind than get aggressive. 

What I would be hedging could be the following:

1. Devaluation of the dollar
2. Increase in interest rates
3. Speculation if/when certain stocks decline in value

My use of the term ""hedge"" is probably not correct except that I'm somewhat hedging risks I think any saver/spender in the currency experiences and trying to remove the risks of rapid changes in interest rates.

The current mark feels a bit like 1999 with high valuations and I'm just waiting patiently for good opportunities. There might already be one or two, but by and large, I don't think the U.S. markets are obviously cheap. I consider this a decent time to buy ""insurance"" and maybe I should say that instead of hedging.";t1_ge7fzzj;t3_k3x9c4;1606793255.0
ge7zk5q;1;"I have wondered the same thing as the original poster and I also feel like ""hedging"" is not specific enough. In my own case it is more of a general feeling that the market tends to forget the negative and doesn't price in the reality of disaster as it ages out memory. (For example it could be argued that the GFC occurred partially because memory of the Great Depression had been lost and finance has been allowed to get exciting and creative again.)  The thing is that it looks very expensive to buy insurance against a general financial apocalypse for the retail investor and my gut tells me that what is available in this part of the market is really only good for hedging in the sense of being able to knock off the worst of the risk of being leveraged. In other words having a bet that is reasonably short term not a true ""tail risk hedge"" in the sense that you have no idea when something considered extraordinary is going to happen but want to buy insurance on that event without knowing what it is going to be. I assume that in the world of institutional or richy rich investing you can go to Goldman Sachs and they will find a counterparty to ""hedge"" against any disaster you can imagine except maybe counterparty risk or nuclear war, maybe you will be overcharged for this but not nearly as much as a retail piker. For me as a plebe all I see is options and futures and options on futures and all of that seems very expensive for the protection you can buy. I wonder if in risk adjusted terms whether buying protection from these sources is actually a loss prospectively, more of a lottery ticket then a hedge.

What you say that seems quite on point is that you cannot hedge against being wrong, I barely understand the portfolio you are describing but it is clear that you are using hedges in order to limit the downside of taking larger risks in order to generate a better return, not buying a hedge against being wrong in the sense of making a mistake and having your bets go sour for a couple of years resulting in a loss compared to some benchmark.";t1_ge7fzzj;t3_k3x9c4;1606791795.0

My questions for you... how do you find indexes/funds you want to buy puts against? Or do you primarily stick to the S&P? I guess it should work fine, but wish I could just pick a basket of what I consider to be very risky companies, though they don't have nearly any liquidity in the options market as you describe.

Additionally - if you are buying options that might be 30% OTM, do you get them expecting to only be paid out on very large declines? And if so, do you have a view the lumpy payouts might end up being more valuable than the quarterly costs you incur? 30% on the S&P is quite a bit... if I could pick some tech names, I would feel the probabilities are probably a little higher.

ge8od81;2;"I hear you and it makes sense. I think you are looking for capital protection, defensive strategies - it’s a very legitimate concern.
My thoughts here... day is just starting... apologies if the coffee has not properly kicked in yet....
Ref. cash - that’s the riskiest asset imo. I have high capital utilisation for exactly that reason - securities ownership is clear, while broker liability can put some doubt over your cash reserves. Even something unsexy like treasuries or a lame etf is better.
Which also solves the inflation problem. If you spend dollars (I am not but I trade in dollars so I have exposure) you want to be in an asset that is repriced with inflation. Especially in these times of unprecedented public spending, we’ve seen the companies where the excess liquidity seems to accumulate to. Owning a position there (and hedging that) seems like good protection to me if you are actively managing your account.
Bottom line: less cash, less risk.

Increase in rates. Hm, that’s a tough one, because you’re breaking with the pack - at least until Yellen takes over the treasury and we know who will succeed Powell, rates are staying low.
I’d put a rolling NOB position using futures to track the yield curve, but again - requires management. There’s probably a lot more things you can do ref interest rate, but it’s another anti-inflationary form of protection and if you think higher rates would have a broader impact on the economy there might be other mechanisms to express your view (options on the interest rate itself if you have a different time horizon for the thesis)

Certain stocks declining in value as a requirement for hedging falls in the strategies already covered by some commenters, maybe more competent than me.
What I think you want is to bet against certain stocks which you don’t own. Which assumes you have alpha, but that is beyond the point.
For example about 18mo ago I shared here my thesis around shorting corporate junk bonds. I had found that given my level of conviction the simplest execution was buying puts on HYG and JNK. That worked a charm in the Great Margin Call of March, but for the wrong reasons (the Fed induced the idea they would buy them and the junk market has been buoyant ever since).
Spreads and ratios (back and front) are an alternative to that depending if your thesis anticipates slow or fast changes in price/volatility.

Last but not silly. There are ways to park capital as you seem to describe - either in near money instruments (some SPACs even can give you upside with carefully made choices) and yield-generating trades on indexes can produce net returns (60-90bps per month) that would probably not offset the inflation but keep you liquid and in the game.

Hope this helps, you seem to have a good idea where you want to be so here’s me keeping fingers crossed it works and you get results.";t1_ge8259t;t3_k3x9c4;1606809432.0
geaq42h;1;"I was about to say in my other post. If you are actually staying in cash when you don't find good opportunities ... then this is probably enough of the hedge already. 

Because in any rug pull you will have cash to buy when things are cheap. Certainly it takes some guts to do it but in the end you will end up in the same spot with regards of the total drawdwond ... more or less. Because think again. ... if you hedge on SPY for example ... and you have let's say 30% drawdown and your hedge now kicks into play. Now you nees to make a decision ... sell the hedge ... and then what? You probably need to buy something as things just got cheaper.

If you sit on that cash anyway ... you don't really need the hedge. It's scary actually but the effect on your sharpe ratio will be about the same. This I learned quite recently as in March my hedge really kicked in ..  and then I sold and didn't buyed and missed a big part of the recovery. 

If you stay a lot in cash then inflation is a bigger risk to hedge for than market drawdown ... you want the market to go down when you sit on a pile of cash. So here hedging with gold might be a better strategy to hedge for inflation.

What you also seems to be looking is to kinda do pair trading ... go long something and short something else ... where the short part being a put for example. But if the put is closer ATM (where the liquidity is) then this is more like a pair trade than really hedging ... and if you pair trade you can go with your put ITM to avoid paying too much theta/IV.

But that's a hole different thing actually.


So to sum up:
1. Devaluation of the dollar / inflation: GLD
2. Interest rate hike ... that will probably mean everything goes down: Cash or far OTM SPY
3. Speculation : far OTM puts somewhere or you design pair strategies for correlated assets. You can execute your pairs with options too or partial with options ... but it gets complicated.";t1_ge8259t;t3_k3x9c4;1606855931.0

If you are interested in learning more about it, there are some really good interviews with short fund managers out there that talk about position management. Jim Chanos, Russell Clark, Tom Claugus, and Dana Galante had some really good interviews I learned from. I love short-selling so I don't mind the headache that much.

Yeah, sorry I was referring to options on ETFs. There are some interesting closed-end bond funds out there too that seem to blow up every crisis. I'm not sure how to do puts on individual bonds, but I would still think puts on the ETFs or funds are superior because they tend to trade at a wide discount to NAV during crises.";t1_ge83fmd;t3_k3x9c4;1607667201.0
ge8ojeb;1;"Primarily, I stick with S&P and therefore, SPY puts. 

Buying options on a basket of risky companies is a possibility. However, liquidity comes into play, and on top of that, risky companies often mean high volatility of the stock and thus leads to expensive cost of hedging. The same goes for tech names. If 'probabilities' of large declines are higher, cost of hedging should be higher too. 

Keeping large declines in mind, tail correlation comes into play. When a lot of companies start to decline, this leads to other declines. Index funds being sold, triggering wider declines. This makes a broad S&P hedge fit for purpose. Naturally, this is not a perfect hedge when one is invested in specific companies. Perfect hedging at a small cost does not exist. But I am happy to be proven wrong on this one. 

Indeed, I hedge solely against tail risk. If the decline is 'only' 10%, the hedge does not come into play as one cannot fully profit from the convexity that makes these far-OTM options valuable. 

The trade-off between lumpy payouts and recurring costs is a difficult one. That is why I probably will not constantly be hedged like this. To me, the approach will be to hedge tail risk when there is a serious threat. The definition of 'serious threat' is without a doubt very subjective.";t1_ge861i2;t3_k3x9c4;1606809596.0

I'll let the long term consequences handle themselves, because I fear being in overvalued securities.

1. Inflation is a longer term issue. And even if I lose some to inflation, it's fine. I don't want to chase real returns and then get crushed in a correction. If we have a scenario, someday, where stocks decline for an extended period, there is no inflation protection. The temporary holding of cash, even a few years, is not the biggest issue. Look at Buffett holding $130+ billion of cash - he's yet to be hugely wrong on his actions by the way.

2. Pair trading gets too complex for someone like me. I've worked hard for the CFA charter and work in the field, but some trades just require too much effort and are subject to risks. LTCM was just doing pair trades too. I can't get into greeks, because that's beyond what I'm comfortable with.

Collar strategies limit your losses and your upside, sell the call, buy the put. In theory, it allows you to own equities with less downside risk and reduced upside risk with minimal expenses.

I'm literally looking at outright puts on companies I have no exposure to. I'm discussing betting against the USD, a rise in interest rates, and so on.

ge6qg1p;2;A hedge usually means that you have a bet in both directions so that you are neutral in the direction.

gea82wc;1;"Hmmm well, it's only semantics if you think hedging (the dollar value of the position is unchanged regardless of the price movement of the underlying asset) is the same as 'hedging' (buying two assets that aren't related like stocks and gold).

One is hedging and the other is telling yourself a comforting lie that you are hedged.

To me, if the dollar value of your portfolio is greatly increased from a call on interest rates or a put on the dollar you are not hedged you are making a directional bet.

For your questions:

1. I hedge based on positions I have

2. The longer dated the option the more forgiving it will be if the trade goes against you. Keep an eye on the implied volatility for the strike you want and try to buy your hedge when it is lower than it has been in a while. 

Also pay attention to the price moves, if it moved up a ton that's a great time to buy a put or sell a call because it will be cheaper. If it dropped a ton that's a great time to buy a call or sell a put. If you are putting in a hedge for long time horizons you have time to wait for a good day to make the trade, just like looking for a great buying opportunity for the stock.

Close to ATM puts in something that usually goes up are sometimes called 'sucker's puts' because the premium is really high but the expected payout is not that great

3. I use collars because it lets you set a profit target and you can use the premium from selling the call to fund buying one or more puts. It also lets you make return when the underlying does not move

4. I agree with you and pretty much perpetually have a long dated call on interest rates that's super OTM.

The law regulating ""AirBnb"" style vacation rentals is flagrantly violated however the politics of it are ambiguous. For every voter concerned about the housing shortage etc. there seems to be one who rents out a room legally or enjoys the service on their travels. I had read that a majority of the revenue to AirBnb comes from the operation of informal hotels which are the clearest example of arbitrage and the strongest argument for more regulatory enforcement but since the data on who rents what is obscured or simply not disclosed by AirBnb it becomes difficult to build the sort of political support that would be necessary to effectively regulate.

I don't think regulation is a risk medium term to AirBnb as the political climate is one where the monetization of every asset not nailed down has an attraction for people who are feeling economic precarity which seems to be a majority thus leading to an absence of enthusiasm to address the externalities that the gig economy in general and AirBnb in particular generate.

I add +2% load factor to 2019.  I think this is modest.
- This feeds entirely to the bottom line as CASM is flat (by definition) while RASM goes up.

Overview

Spirit Airlines, headquartered in Miramar, Florida, offers affordable travel to value-conscious customers. Our all-Airbus fleet is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States. We currently serve more than 600 daily flights to 77 destinations in 16 countries throughout the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Our stock trades under the symbol ""SAVE"" on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"").

Our ultra low-cost carrier, or ULCC, business model allows us to compete principally by offering customers unbundled base fares that remove components traditionally included in the price of an airline ticket. By offering customers unbundled base fares, we give customers the power to save by paying only for the Á La SmarteTM options they choose, such as checked and carry-on bags, advance seat assignments, priority boarding and refreshments. We record revenue related to these options as non-fare passenger revenue, which is recorded within passenger revenues in our statements of operations.

“If one had to describe Alphabet funds’ collective portfolio of venture deals in one word, it would be “eclectic.” Unlike many corporate venture portfolios, there doesn’t appear to be a unifying, cohesive theme to Alphabet’s outside investments. The AI-focus of Gradient Ventures aside, Alphabet is just as likely to invest in a homeowners insurance company like Lemonade or a customer support platform like UJET (which Crunchbase News covered recently) as it is to invest in non-dairy milk producer Ripple Foods or African tech recruiting platform Andela.

The diversity of Alphabet’s venture investments echoes the diverse collection of businesses, initiatives and long-shot bets under its corporate umbrella. And just like it’s difficult to predict what kind of new project Alphabet will launch next, it seems that no amount of searching and sifting can say what its venture arms will embrace next. “

gdqawav;2;I work the same job OP does. It varies by the company and team you PM for, but it's usually non-technical (especially for a consumer facing company like airbnb).

There may be a small difference in departure time but the products are otherwise the same. Airlines are the closest comparison and that’s why Uber and Lyft will likely never justify their valuations.

In contrast, a place to stay that both I and my significant other like is nowhere near as interchangeable. If we could conceivably find another place for $10 less a night it’s just not worth the trouble. And as a former AirBNB host the amount of volume they drove my way made it unnecessary to list on VRBO or any other competitors. So IMO they have the best product from both the buy and sell side.";t1_gdqdsor;t3_k1qyyr;1606450356.0

gdqh2uw;1;I'd agree but in my experience, Uber is cheaper vast majority of the times... I think your point is no different in ABNB either - it literally just costs me 20 sec to do the exact same listing and while goods are not homogeneous, I'll choose whatever is best value - and I'm not sure it's clearly ABNB in most cases from a user's perspective. I will say ABNB definitely has more inventory (I think it's like 60-70% vs. 30-40% for VRBO + Booking). But competition is more real with hotels (I definitely have gotten better deals with hotels than ABNB in cities). If you're gonna use Uber, you're not gonna try to hail a cab and ask for prices...;t1_gdqfv8f;t3_k1qyyr;1606451209.0

gdprdvn;1;"I don't have any illusions that we are competitive with the larger funds that can shell out tens of millions on data (competing solely in the S&P 500 universe) and are armed to the teeth with data for every company in that index and often playing quarterly earnings, and we are not in the same universe as quant funds/trading firms that don't have the same time horizon for holdings.

I'd say the comp here is discretionary funds that can hold sub-$10B companies in their portfolio comfortably and so gave a $5B aum limit. The largest asset managers don't usually play in this space and so many small ones either don't have the firepower or just haven't really built their idea generation/investing process in this manner so that's where I think we have an advantage.

Also have all transcripts for some sentiment scoring and use the 10-Q/K to pull out interesting sections. For example I can pull all litigation-related information over 5 years for almost any company to see over time. Have used the filings for a few other screens on that as well that are interesting.

Market/transaction/professional/fund/financials data setup I built as well, it's a ton of tables but the data itself is just pulled from an existing (popular, I assume you can guess) product that is thankfully liberal with their access so we don't have to pay for the direct feeds that are quite expensive.

Have been >20% a year for the 5 prior which perhaps isn't super interesting but we benchmark to the R2K where many holdings are and consider peers sub-5B aum hedge funds and similar funds.

gdrptc9;1;"Good questions, happy to share a bit!

a. Both - at the screening/idea gen level, every company is scored on almost 600 different moving pieces that cover all areas of a company, and so can sort them using 3 methods so can find the ""best and worst companies"" in each industry. This brings out some great ideas and they're always moving targets so changing regularly. 

I still have to work on the robustness of the scoring methodology itself, but it's comforting that our top decile performs far better than industry average and bottom performs far worse across most industries, so this can only get better. Also because we use it as a starting point/idea gen can pretty quickly filter out companies we aren't interested in or that have problems in our blind spots at the next level.

Then, at the individual company level, it provides the info pulled out that we need to know that isn't synthesized. So in that fraud keyword dashboard, I can see which keywords hit for company ABC, the press release link for each name, and the filings in which that name shows up so can connect the dots. Can also look for the specific keyword and see what other companies pop up, their average returns after the name hits on the filing, and what scores we've given them. Pretty simple idea but saves hours of going down rabbit holes.

b. Scrappiness does wonders, accomplished this with a cheap subscription to SA and a web scrape script I commissioned off Upwork that crawls along slowly enough...

c. The tables are real time, I update every few days as don't need pricing data. They have excellent corp dev (and more recently corp gov, which has been a treasure chest for building new idea gen screens). I'll send you the name, they are quite lenient about access but still get messages once in a while about pulling millions of data points on a fair use basis haha. The API service gets expensive (into the $300-500k range for everything we use) so I did it more roundabout. Basically it took almost a year to build out the basic data pipeline for everything and been tackling bugs and fixing errors since but it's like 97% there today, ""good enough"".

d. You're 100% right on this, it was indeed difficult to attract institutional even with good track record. We ended up pivoting to a FO structure, are currently in the 9-figure AUM. Part of the deal with the family (prominent asset manager) was getting access to the infrastructure to start launching some external vehicles targeted at institutional investors so that's how we could scale with the name, infrastructure, and process and a smaller team. Just getting started on that after a few years with the FO so will see how it goes...";t1_gdrl2yx;t3_k1g77t;1606489415.0
gdrjfbv;4;Renaissance Medallion did 66% for 30 years. Also that's the best fund in the world.

And how do you use ML to do risk management? and lastly how do you determine when to enter and exit position? is it just like a traditional valuation approach where you enter if undervalued and exit when overvalued or do you use more quant approach to trade around the valuation?

gdyvso6;2;"This article seems to contradict itself. First it says if the street is short gamma then volatility increases.  Which is what happens in March and arguably in November run up.

But then a few paragraphs later it also says high volatility flattens gamma curve spreading across more strike prices (assuming  away from at the money strike)

Am I following correctly? 

So as the street is short gamma (as it is in November) then volatility increases. This higher volatility the  acts against the gamma that is driving it and dissapates/ flattens the curve across other strikes that are farther from at the money. Thus this is reducing volatility. It seems like gamma is a force acting against itself slowing it's rate of change as  volatility increases, thereby slowing down Volatility.

Historically, you're absolutely right, but the world has changed. The move to tech means we're very much in winner take all environments, or a limited number of competitors in a marketplace meaning your ROEs/ROICs/margins are going to be great. 

>Growth in earnings doesn’t mean anything if  returns on capital are equal to the cost of capital. Growth only adds  value when returns on capital are above costs on capital, and that’s  only sustainable if a company has a wide moat. 

Yeah, which most of these tech companies absolutely do. I'm not saying all of them do, but once you build something and are gaining market share at a rapid pace, it's very hard for anyone to catch you now unless you completely stop improving the product. There's currently very little incentive to do anything like that. I can see there possibly being competition when we are completely saturated with software developers which forces companies to start looking for other ways to make money (i.e., undercutting current providers), but we are a very long ways away from that making sense, and I think some other disruption will hit us before that does.

Ok, then why do I continuously see value investors incredulous at 100x P/E or or 30x EV/EBITDA? I'm not saying everyone does this, but it's clear that consensus over the past decade did which is why tech precipitously rose (alongside declining interest rates to be fair).

gdm6leo;5;"Tech started at very low multiples after the Great Recession, as did most quality stocks. They were undervalued relative to value stocks which had multiples in a similar range. For example, AAPL and MSFT both had P/E ratios below 12 in 2012. 
 
The reason they performed so well was earnings growth *plus* multiple expansion. As the bull market went on and multiple expansion supercharged returns, fund inflows into tech continued and sped up the process even more. After a decade of superb returns, investors have convinced themselves that tech (and quality companies in general), are worth buying at any price. That’s how you end up with even apparel and pest control companies like Lululemon and Rollins at P/Es over 60. 

The problem with tech is that companies like AMZN or MSFT are the exception, not the rule. While there are certainly network effects and switching costs to be found in tech, these apply to a minority of companies. Winner take all doesn’t work in competitive industries subject to rapid change like tech. Just look at how many tech companies have appeared over the past decade, many of which have yet to show any evidence of value creation whatsoever. Barriers to entry are low and supply is at record highs. To be bullish on tech now is to be convinced the world really is different and that the typical economics of competition don’t apply anymore.

A few key takeaways I've learned worth thinking about:

1. Industry matters. Selling by insiders in software companies is fairly meaningless, bank insider selling is not. Buying is relevant in both.
2. How much they sold relative to their holdings and company size is important. I really don't care if Bezos is selling $1B of stock. It's more interesting if he's selling $30B.
3. Cluster selling/buying by multiple C-suite/directors are often more interesting than single transactions.
4. Someone that sells like clockwork every year for taxes/quarterly bonus on 10b5-1 plan is not that interesting. However, if they're sharply increasing/decreasing the amount sold, or have launched a new plan that accelerates the sale of a significant number of shares, or have suddenly hit the pause button on buying/selling, that's interesting. Insiders often tend to try to 'mask' their big buys/sells by doing it through a 10b5-1 plan so it doesn't flag, but this is how it often shows up.

gdx6m6i;1;"I always look at it. I have to assess the credibility I give to each person's buy/sale transactions however. 

Here are some examples:

1. Board members who never buy... if you're on the board of a company for 10+ years, surely you've learned to identify when the firm's stock is undervalued. If you never buy, then it's a negative in my view regarding the strength of the board.

2. CEO that buys... I might like it, but before I take a view, I also run it through a mental filter. Could they be buying just as a signal to the markets? Do they want support from market participants in an upcoming capital raise/debt issuance? Is it just a token amount that is dwarfed by their salary and likely range of net worth? 

3. Do they always sell and essentially never retain stock?

I think management transactions are 1 piece to consider. You have to understand the industry, in my opinion, to get an idea of how to assess their buy/sale of the stock. Sometimes, the price is very high and implicitly makes assumptions that you and/or management don't think are likely, but still, the market has the view. Sometimes, it's the opposite and they buy.

I don't think there's much risk in the royalty names at this point (VNOM, FLMN, KRP, MNRL in the US, FRU and PSK in Canada), so if you want that type of exposure I would go with one of the names there or even a basket.

If you want a bit more torque, I would find a lower cost E&P who has a strong track record and hasn't blown anything up. There are very few of these, but in general I'd look for high returns on equity (trust me, there aren't many of these) and other return metrics. One example is PXT on the TSX. They have jurisdiction risk with assets in Colombia, but you can look at the chart and see how superior the stock has been to pretty much everything else in the space. The companies I'd suggest here would be ones that are still profitable with WTI in the $40-45 range.

If you are pretty bullish on oil, you can go to a slightly worse producer with even more exposure that works at a $50-55 WTI price. They don't necessarily have great return metrics, but you'll see a lot more upside (and downside in these names).

- Developing nations, a lot of whom are still largely dependent on coal will transition to oil and natural gas, Exxon taking steps to secure LNG

- As the lower classes become the middle classes, demand for energy *will* increase, something renewables can't completely cover even accelerating current trends

- International travel, driving, etc. will grow with the international middle class

- Oil is used in everything. infrastructure projects, plastics, feed, textiles, cosmetics, sports equipment, medical supplies, household products, etc.

- While oil demand *growth* is projected to peak between 2025-2040, oil demand itself will continue to remain strong


Investment Opportunity that arises for ExxonMobil in particular:

- ExxonMobil is expanding their refinery and chemical footprint, something that can and likely will be leveraged by developing countries to add value to their crude oil

- ExxonMobil is taking aggressive steps moving into LNG, which has a longevity far ahead of oil and is much cleaner

- Even if, hypothetically, oil *demand* somehow peaks in, say, 2025, the competitors ExxonMobil has will diminish by a great deal as the likes of Equinor, Denmark, BP, Shell, etc. have plans to diversify. also, oil will still remain a very valuable commodity

- ExxonMobil is investing heavily in carbon capture and biofuels, both of which benefit from aggressive climate policy that we are seeing in the Western world, as well as ramping up production of ethanol, which is quickly replacing alkane in combustion engines

People are sick of COVID, and lockdowns won't affect oil demand anywhere near what we've seen. I think we could see oil dip back into the $30s as there will be some demand destruction.

Vaccine delays, even if they do happen, probably only push things back 3-5 months which won't matter when there's not a rush of oil supply waiting for the vaccine.

Mutation/rejection risk is also not a risk to me, because if that happens we won't go back into lockdowns waiting for another vaccine because no one will believe that we'll be able to have a legitimate working vaccine. Society will just end up accepting the risk as COVID slowly mutates itself into another common cold. There will be a lot of death along the way, but that's the reality.

1. There is some overcapacity in the Permian due to the massive capex of the recent past. Rates will have to come down once the fixed term contracts expire.
2. As you said, future Permian growth won't be like the past.

The main thing I like is that growth capex also won't be like the past. The way I see it, the midstreams with good balance sheets will consolidate the industry and be in a position to milk low capex cash flow for a very long time to come.

The investors from the previous decade basically paid for all the expansion, and now that the write downs and dividend cuts are the in the rear view mirror, present buyers are in the position of enjoying the low capex, positive cash flow future.

In the event that oil prices increase, Permian will be the first to respond with increased production. It is the global swing producer at this point. The volumes won't be like the past, and capital discipline will be better with industry consolidation, so the midstreams won't be the biggest beneficiaries.

If you assume the average car gets 25mpg, and the average car gets driven 13,500 mile/year (US DoT), then the average car consumes 540 gallons or approximately 13 barrels of oil/year. To reduce oil consumption by 1mbpd, we need to replace 28 million gas cars with electric.

2.1 million EVs were sold globally in 2019. There is simply no plausible way that enough gas cars get converted to EVs quickly enough to make up the difference. China alone added more than 25 million cars and trucks in 2019, only 1 million of those are EVs.

High oil prices will drive EV adoption, and capacity constraints throughout the supply chain will drive up the prices of both batteries and the raw materials. High oil prices will also drive inflation throughout the commodity supply chains from production to transport.

The combination of commodity price inflation and high debt levels will force some very hard choices.";t1_gdhxgip;t3_k0fjiq;1606261064.0

It won't grow in perpetuity on an exponential basis, but I think it's pretty fair to expect new EVs to grow at a rate of 25-50% which is still exponential growth. I agree infrastructure broadly will slow down the adoption. However, there is the 'risk' of tech in EVs that allow for more better/different batteries to help address that issue.

I ran some servers back when Youtube got started and did back of the envelope math of how much data a video transfers, how many you could serve in a month, and so on.

It was only later that I realized how much the cost of Adwords and internet advertising would go up. The crazy high effectiveness of their marketing (compared to a billboard, etc.) allowed the price to go up.

gdamcmx;3;"I don't actually. I think rising prices on Adwords should have been a given, but let me lay out some of the puts/takes I had at the time. It led me to the view that I didn't know how far it would go.

If you have more opinions though, could you share them with me? I know very little about the space. 

Pro: Google Adwords were highly effective. If someone typed in ""domain names,"" then odds are they want to buy a domain name. It's super easy to pay Google for 50 clicks, you track the visitors, and calculate how many buy a domain name. For the first few years, it was so easy to make money, you just had to be willing to ratchet up the price you paid as others started to figure out the trick. Almost anyone could have made money if they had something to sell or earn a commission. The ""instant math"" you could do was relatively easy and it becomes much harder in the physical world with billboards or TV ads for example. (I've heard of tricks like doing a state ""blackout"" to measure impact of marketing... it's outside of my expertise.)

Pro: Adwords were found on many websites. If you wanted to advertise something across the web, Google's Adwords system made it so easy. In fact, which other network was as effective? (Maybe things have changed) The only niches where you made more money selling your own ads were niche sites like Anandtech.com that catered to a specific subset of users. You could more profitably deal directly with advertisers, but this didn't apply to the wealth of sites. Google had a product that grew harder to compete with as more people used it... essentially an auction market place. 

Con: It was said that people would soon just go to Amazon directly to purchase products and bypass Google. The risk is you don't know what % of searches were at risk, how much money they brought in, and so on.

Con: Advertising rates could decline if privacy laws changed, another search engine gained momentum, etc.";t1_gdakzcy;t3_jz59xb;1606100650.0

Twitch is trying to diversify to include more than just gaming. Youtube has been more successful here because a lot of companies, including Apple, are now live streaming their events on Youtube and not Twitch. In addition, many companies like Apple see Twitch as a place with a lot of internet trolls and they don't want to associate their image with them.

However, Youtube hasn't really been great at capturing the live gaming market despite having a significantly larger overall audience and arguably, far better tech. Twitch's website is slow, not super user friendly, and the video buffers far more than Youtube. Despite Twitch's issues, Youtube hasn't made a huge dent. In my opinion, this is because Twitch is laser-focused on gaming streaming while Youtube's overall strategy is streaming overall. Twitch is able to cater to gaming streamers' needs faster and better. So Youtube's large audience is hindering its goal of capturing more of the live gaming market.";t1_gdd8ong;t3_jz59xb;1606367520.0
gd9ouka;21;"This is probably the most important question in investing. Some people say you can't forecast meaningfully, and therefore shouldn't try, but there is no escaping the fact that when you invest in a company you are making assumptions about the future. That is true whether the company is trading on a low multiple of current earnings or is assuming a higher proportion of returns from future earnings growth. You therefore need to work out what assumptions or forecasts you can make with meaningful accuracy even though you are very likely to be somewhat incorrect.

One data source that I've found helpful to do this is the Credit Suisse  Base Rate book by Michael Mauboussin (pdfs available via Google). It gives loads of different statistics on how company fundamentals change over time on a sector by sector basis. You can then use this as a benchmark against your own assumptions to see if you are being overly optimistic or pessimistic. 

I would also recommend reading Super forecasting by Phil Tetlock and Dan Gardner as a guide to what makes good forecasts. Their initial findings are pretty interesting and concerning in that they suggest experts often perform worse than novices due to over confidence. Reassuringly though they also suggest accurate forecasts can be made in some circumstances when applying good practices such as evidence based and probabilistic thinking.


Practically for me, when investing it means focussing on companies where there is a very wide margin of error being priced-in. For example some of the companies being directly affected by covid such as airlines  were being priced as if nobody would go flying again (prior to the vaccine news). One forecast I felt reasonably confident making at that time was that sooner or later as many people would be flying as they had been in the past. I didn't need to be any more specific than that given the share prices, so I was more likely to be correct. This is one of the key points for me - The more accurate your forecast needs to be, the more likely you are to be wrong.

This is why the wide margin of error is important and is also why Michael Mauboussin suggests working out what the market is pricing-in first and then assess how realistic that is.

I also find it helpful looking at company historical data,  as the best guide to the future is the past. This is also why it is very difficult to invest in turn-arounds since you are effectively predicting the future will be materially different to the past. 

TLDR. keep forecasts high level and broad. Use historical 'base rate' as a guide and make sure the share price is giving you a wide margin of error.";t3_jz3454;t3_jz3454;1606083851.0

gdc7bi4;2;"I have to agree 101% with this answer. The first assumption behind OP's question is that quantifying uncertain inputs is *necessary*. The second assumption is that you should look at inputs individually, quantify each of them individually, and then assemble them from the bottom-up to get the full picture valuation. This is the essence of DCF.

The alternative, as suggested by the commenter above, is to start from the top-down. Get a good 30,000 feet view of what the investment looks like from above, identify its moving parts, and see the whole forest first. Then work your way down, and down, and down, until you get to a sufficiently deep level of analysis that will serve your original purpose.

Once you have a good ""feel"" of all the investment's moving parts from a holistic ""business economics"" POV, you can proceed with your ""gut feel"" about certain inputs based on your broadly comprehensive grasp of things.

>E.g. How will e-commerce growth stocks in EM countries perform? Is it really necessary to nail down an exact number for future shipping cost growth by analyzing whether they're optimizing on-demand delivery? Or is enough to just quickly browse whether the growth rate of the wider e-commerce industry will justify CAPEX into company-owned delivery vehicles. rendering the above point moot? (as the gains from operating leverage will offset any reasonably possible unit cost growth for shipping)

Recognize that quantifying real-life developments with precision is generally not the best use of your time. As OP has rightly pointed out, some things are just a waste of time to quantify accurately. Need a good feel of the economy before buying a stock? Why compile Fed statistics when you can just check Bloomberg for electricity usage statistics and rail volumes? You're a stock investor, not an economist - so do whatever maximizes the ROI of your time spent, rather than striving for perfect information. Apply this to every input, with a focus on maximizing ROI on time spent, not superior information. That means settling for a broader range of valuation if you can't get pinpoint precision on your inputs, if it allows you to arrive at a practically useful decision.

gdlo2rp;2;"Yes, margin of error and margin of safety are broadly the same thing. I just used the term margin of error because it represents more clearly how I think about forecasts, which is in the probabilistic/statistical sense.

In response to your other two questions:

1: You can never have complete conviction about what scenario the market is pricing-in but I simply look at it in terms of quite rough earnings growth and returns requirements. Long run equity returns are c8% and then I work backwards from that to workout what earnings growth the stock is assuming. So taking Tesla as an example. it is expected to generate c$2bn of net income this year and it is trading on roughly 250x PE. To get to a return of 8% that PE needs to shrink to 12.5x (1/8%) so at the current market cap of $500bn (very roughly) it would need to generate income of $40bn at maturity for this level of return. The current profit pool for global auto OEMs is roughly $100bn so this implies the market is assuming Tesla achieves some combination of increasing the profit pool through higher margins and gaining market share to get to that $40bn. If we assume 50:50 split between these two factors it would require them to achieve 20% market share (double the current leader) and have net margins double the industry average, which probably means c15%. These is certainly a possible scenario but would you say it is probable? And this is before taking into account time value of money and any upside you might want on these assumptions. So although it's possible, the risk/reward feels very unattractive.

2. This is much the same as above. You will never have complete conviction but very occasionally you come across companies which for whatever reason the market is clearly undervaluing. It generally happens when there is extreme uncertainty in the short term but the longer term picture remains broadly unchanged. It is generally  quite rare though, I typically only find one idea a year where I have high conviction that there is a clear material misvaluation. The rest of the time I just need to take a probabilistic approach and choose companies that have the best margin of safety *relative* to all other options.

As to the refinery thesis, yeah refineries are hard to build in Canada but...why does Canada even need another refinery? You have a few recent comps you can value the refineries at (Parkland buying the Burnaby refinery, Prince George refinery), and frankly the Burnaby refinery is one of the best competitively positioned refineries there is, so I don't think there's any crazy value being missed there.

I never really advocated for investing in oilsands, but said if you wanted Canadian oilsands exposure that CNRL is probably the way to go. MEG is pretty good if you're more bullish on oil prices and are fine with more solvency risk if things go south the next 12 months.

That said, what do we mean by ""environmentally damaging""? Emissions intensity is likely higher, but currently Canadian production is some of the most focused on bringing down emissions because of the pressure they've been facing which other producers haven't. This might change with a Biden govt in power where US oil production requires the same 'social license' Canada does.

Coal isn't a very good analogue here. The highest cost production will be the first to go, but we're still a decent distance away from seeing any major demand destruction (5+ years) from electric cars. Maybe oil sands WILL be the highest cost production if carbon taxes adversely affect it, but I can't predict that currently. 

On the contrary, I would bet that heavy oil will be some of the last to go with Canada somewhat uniquely positioned. The US refineries are heavily geared to accept heavy oil because previously oil production was primarily heavier grades. You can retool the refineries at major costs, but if you're expect oil to die in the next 30-40 years, those costs probably don't make sense, similar to it not making sense to build light oil refineries in the meantime. The other benefit to Canadian oil is a lot of the projects are great inflation hedges.

I can't tell you, I was asking if you knew since it was your thesis. I personally don't know, but have looked at refineries in the past. 

The problem with looking at the value is because its not a reliable indicator of value for several reasons. First, book value is essentially replacement value, or the cost to reproduce the asset. If the NPV < replacement value, an informed industrialist will not pay book value for the asset. If NPV > replacement value, then you have a case for valuing the asset in excess of book value, but we need to know what the NPV is. The problem with you assuming a simple multiple on the net income of these refineries is that these assets don't really have a terminal value. First, they process product for upstream customers based on contracts. The contracts are where all of the value is. Without contracts, the physical assets (what the book value represents) have zero value. The contracts are not into infinity, so you need to figure out what the PV of the contracted cash flows are and the liklihood of contract extension and any potential upward or downward revisions in rate. These are not details the Company will likely give you, but you can see the refineries throughput and utilization details in their filings and get an idea what sort of production they're doing.

This is the best answer here.

I'll just add that the KPIs I reference depend on the business. If I have a bias, it's in studying ROE and comparing it to the P/B multiple. For example - if I'm investing and looking for a 7% rate of return, then a 14% ROE could imply paying up to 2x P/B. You have to study many other aspects (debt load, future prospects, etc.) to use this effectively so I can't just tell people it's my only formula. 

This approach doesn't work for all businesses though, because not all firms are capital constrained in the ""normal"" way we might look at financial statements. My choice of metric really varies.

The one metric that I think people are fooling themselves with, however, is adjusted EBITDA. I don't think it's entirely flawed, but I would prefer if firms actually justified the measure they use and I know of only a few that give rationale.

gd8mjl6;11;"> Doesn’t it make sense to leave out taxes

Not sure if there was a joke embedded in that :)

I think it can be distorting for a few reasons:

1. It's usually applied in a way to calculate enterprise value, which is the firm's entire value. An EV/EBITDA multiple can be used, but it can be misleading. If you have a lot of debt and have to restructure (through bankruptcy or other means), then your EV/EBITDA multiple will give a misleading signal that the stock is still worthwhile. We know that in bankruptcy, equity holders are generally wiped out. (The situations where it is not is generally beyond my knowledge, but I think that's something like 1% of outcomes...)

2. With some recent accounting changes, lease expenses can be classified as depreciation instead of coming out of the operating budget. This will push the EBITDA figure higher without any real earnings growth, and when you slap a multiple on it (step 1), it gets even more ridiculous on the valuation it implies.

3. Some firms *always* have random one time charges. If you get one time charges every decade, then it's fine, but I've seen firms where it's easier to just bake in a certain % of revenue going to one-time charges. Managements prefer to ""adjust"" these out, but I'm not sure it always makes sense...

4. ITDA are all expenses. If I run a factory and incur depreciation, then I probably spent some Capex to fix up things that wore out over time. Therefore, I'm not sure something like depreciation should be backed out. (There are times, such as when you're ""winding down"" a business for liquidation when you might economically back it out, but that's a tough tough game and I rarely hear that justification...) This type of discussion goes for all of the items.

5. One of the adjustments that is ridiculous is backing out stock compensation. If this isn't an expense, what exactly is it?

I could rant on and on forever about this topic. I'm just not thrilled by EBITDA. Call me a worry-wort or just old fashioned, but I agree with Charlie Munger when he says it's like putting lipstick on a pig.";t1_gd8i2j1;t3_jyx4af;1606067231.0
gd8kfki;7;"I'll tell you what had the most profound impacts on me, but of course this might not apply for everyone.

1. Basic foundations - Alice Schroeder's *The Snowball* to get introduced to basic concepts like buying a business with more cash in the bank account than the entire price of the firm. Ben Graham's *The Intelligent Investor* goes into this a little further. Valuation of a liquidation was an interesting place to start, because it has fewer long term variables, questions of discount rates, etc. The really fun part is you're close to the question of, ""If there is an envelope with $1 inside, would you buy it for $0.50? Would you buy it for $1.50?"" If you can answer this, then you can value these firms known at net-nets that sell for low prices. There aren't as many in modern society, but maybe you can dig some up or be ready when the markets have a hiccup.

2. As I began to study ""living businesses"" more, *How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor* (Fortune magazine 1977, Buffett) taught me something really interesting about why ROEs come back to 13% and to view stocks as 100-year duration bonds. This mentality took some time to sink in, but it suddenly made a lot of sense.

3. Studying an industry in depth - I worked for an insurer at the time and noticed that some insurers were doing an odd thing: They were shrinking their revenues (premiums) drastically, but not laying off employees. This wasn't because their business was failing, but because the rate they received in exchange for taking catastrophe risk was declining too much. If you're a truly rational insurance manager, you should take a pass on business that is priced too low, and that's precisely what some firms will do. At least one of those firms was so rational that they just bought back their own stock and that made a lot money for shareholders versus writing policies at low prices. There were so many things going right that it was a no brainer, but you had to study the industry a little bit to understand why it made sense to shrink the business without laying off employees.

4. For valuations... I would just create a basic DCF. Pick a business with a profitable past (avoid really weird things for your first one, like a firm headed for default or an internet company that shows a billion dollar loss per year). Collect 10 years of financials in an Excel spreadsheet and find the handful of variables that matter, probably things like gross margin, revenue growth, etc. and forecast them into the future based on industry fundamentals. I would avoid financial firms for this exercise and mining companies. 

The DCF process has been more helpful for me when trying to learn about a wide variety of industry and focus my attention to the primary value drivers. It's not a necessity in my opinion.";t1_gd8h82n;t3_jyx4af;1606066352.0

If a company is so predictable that it can be valued reliably using an earnings ratio, that will be clear to everyone in the market - what is the opportunity except value traps?

gdc3fau;1;"RISC-V has the same problem as Linux. It is starting from a small niche base, which means developers won't want to code their applications for it as there is little commercial viability, which means that users won't want to adopt it.

Open-source software platforms need to break past a certain critical mass before they can get the user-developer flywheel spinning and become commercially viable. Usually you need a large corporation with abundant resources capable of forcing that development through sheer strength of will - but even then it's no guarantee, as seen with Windows Phone OS.

With ARM basically being the Windows of its industry, it's very hard to see RISC-V becoming commercially viable even in the medium-term, unless it is inherently superior at running some sort of huge industry-level technological breakthrough (e.g. VR for mobile?).

gcwb0so;5;I still have every intention of investing in Roblox, but giving a third of all revenue back to developers is not what I wanted to see.;t3_jxfo13;t3_jxfo13;1605836400.0
gcxe4y9;10;It will probably be good for the long-term growth of the company in terms of attracting more developers which will lead to more content and then more users.;t1_gcwb0so;t3_jxfo13;1605864677.0
gd3ihsk;6;"A third (36% to be exact) is indeed what you get when you divide developer fees by the revenue for the past 9 month, but the actual royalty payout is about half that. Here is why.

The margins are easy to compute directly. Roblox has two payout levels. Content (games) developers get 70% of the Robux players pay. Accessory (avatars) creators get 30%. Additionally, the company is basically a market maker for Robux with a hefty bid/ask spread. Players buy Robux for an average of $0.01, according to the S-1 (which is a bit lower than the current prices, which as a parent I know very well: $0.0125 as a one-time purchase or $0.01 as a subscription). Developers can sell their Robux to the company for $0.0035.

Overall this translates to 25% royalty for developers and 11% for creators. The effective rate is somewhere in between. What is it and why are fees to revenue showing 36%?

That's because revenue is not meaningful for this estimate. Roblox recognizes bookings (actual Robux sales) over the ""average lifetime of a paying user"", which they say is 23 months. I see this as mostly an accounting play to create a respectable smooth revenue stream in the statements. I know Robux spending habits of my son, which must be about the same as spending habits of any 8 year-old. I encourage him to ""spend wisely"", and I'm surprised when he doesn't spend any purchase within a week. It's more reasonable to assume that Robux are spent, partially credited to developers, and redeemed for money within a month or so.

Thus, fees to developers should be compared to bookings and not revenue. Bookings for the past 9 months were 1.24B, indicating a 17% effective royalty payout.";t1_gcwb0so;t3_jxfo13;1605987047.0
gcxw70r;3;Oh for sure. And they went on to say they intend to maximize payouts to developers. But for a company losing $100 million/year, with a fantastic but unsustainable growth, who has made no effort to capture a market over age 15, I'm right to be a little concerned about future profitability issues. I'm not out, I still plan to buy the IPO, but the numbers don't look as good as I was hoping for.;t1_gcxe4y9;t3_jxfo13;1605881021.0

gdr0rk8;1;I'm not super familiar with Roblox itself, but is there an argument that to capture a different demographic their best, most realistic chance depends on devs rather than anything 1st hand they try to do?;t1_gcxw70r;t3_jxfo13;1606467504.0
gcyf1c7;3;"That's the million dollar question, and for me, the single most important question for me deciding whether or not to invest. They're growing it, but will it be enough? They've already made it clear that the child demographic isn't financially lucrative enough to support their business model, barring a dramatic increase in their ability to monetize them. I like the Roblox premium subscription model, but again I'm not sure that's enough. I wouldn't mind them exploring ad based revenue. It can be done without being terribly intrusive or detrimental to game play. But I really see expanding age demographics as the only path to profit. 

Fortunately, the sheer volume of users, and the incentive to developers is enough that I think they'll be able to adapt and grow, similar to how minecraft has retained an older user base, but time will tell. I'm still in this company, but I'm probably not as ""break down the door guns blazing"" bullish as a lot of other investors.";t1_gcycrre;t3_jxfo13;1605890887.0

gcylkjd;3;"I'm not an expert on this by any means. I'm not a gamer, I've never played either minecraft or roblox. My skills, such as they are, lie exclusively in reading financial statements and analyzing paper data. 

My guess is that Roblox just doesn't have many offerings for an older demographic. With 25% of its entire user base under age 9, and over 50% under 13, I'm guessing a majority of games are geared to kids. I would think that teens and older look down on playing games with essentially a bunch of toddlers. I would also guess minecraft offers more individual creativity and expression for the average user.

But there again, Roblox has lucrative incentives for developers who create games that keep users on the platform. All it would take is a few developers with a dedicated effort to target those demographics to keep older (and more cash positive) individuals playing.";t1_gcyijum;t3_jxfo13;1605894010.0

\-Adjusted for buybacks, their capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF. They need more money to return little to shareholders. They've bought back stock at aggressive paces, reducing outstanding shares by almost 50% since 2010. Even if you leave buybacks there and don't add them back then you still have the same exact problem. Their capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF growth.

\-The new CEO, Bruce Thorn, recently left Mens Wearhouse and they're getting ready to leave restructuring bankruptcy. I'm not going to throw all that blame on him as that would be unfair. The various economic headwinds that Mens Wearhouse faced due to Amazon and the like aren't fair to throw onto a management team. But you have to look at who is running the company. That much can't be ignored. I'm immediately raising eyebrows if a CEO left a company and that company is in financial trouble and goes to run a new company.

\-Total debt has grown 14.88% while total asset have grown only 7.82% over the past ten years. DSI has grown from 60.34 days in 2017, bloating to 67.56 days in FY2019, to 63.16 days in FY2020. They make a lot of their sales from furniture and home decor, thins that people aren't readily buying every single day so I have to keep in mind that a high DSI may be reasonable based on what they sell. But COVID has backed up supply chains for receiving furniture to sell and DSI was rising when there was a bull market. How are they going to get bad inventory off of their books now when COVID is causing closures to their stores and their supply chains? Consignment sales? Who is going to buy it? Inventory write downs? Market won't like that. Reducing their prices? Cut their margins and the market won't like that.

\-Last year alone selling their distribution center in CA made up 53% of EBIT last fiscal year. Pull that out and EBIT and net income saw a massive decline. They've been entering into a lot of leaseback transactions as well that I think ultimately obscure low quality earnings and cash flow. How many more properties can they sell off to boost EBIT? They have a massive store footprint already at 1,400 stores. They're economically profitable at gross margins around 40% with little standard deviation over the past decade. But looking at their competitors their EBIT margins are garbage. Ollie's, their most direct competitor, has 12.2% EBIT margins. In their proxy statement's peer compensation section their don't see Ollie's as part of their ""peer"" market though. They seem to think they compete alongside companies like Express and L Brands and Abercrombie and Dollar General and Five Below. Look at all their EBIT margins and they still fall so short of EBIT margins against their competitors. This company is poorly run.

\-CA, FL, TX, and OH gave them 33% of net sales in FY2020. OH and CA just announced curfews to control COVID outbreaks and I suspect FL and TX will be forced to deal with COVID outbreaks later on in the same way. Ignoring it means more deaths and ultimately they will have to do something to curb infection rates. Big Lots aims to sell to the JCPenny demographic, the ""I want more bang for my buck/I want to feel like I'm getting a deal at your expense"" crowd. This crowd is hurting badly from unemployment rates being high and government financial support being low. What cash do they think their customers have to pay for furniture that they couldn't sell when the economy was doing good? I don't see them making those sales back soon enough to fix problems the business has. Apollo Management was aiming to take them private but the leaseback transactions that Big Lots was doing at the time of those talks made Apollo drop the idea. It seems Big Lots may be left to flounder in the public markets for a little while longer.

gcwvz7u;5;"My feedback would be that this is a good start on understanding sales drivers and it's important not to stop there. 

Not saying this applies to you but I think many market participants in the stocks you mentioned are stopping after a review of how strong sales will be. Without trying to figure out whether or not the positive sales outlook is already priced in (and more) by the market valuation of the stock concerned one can't have conviction that one has an edge. 

In my opinion pretty heavy optimism about sales is already priced in to the valuations of the stocks listed in the post. Over the longer term people buying at these valuations are risking losing a large share of their money unless the future is even brighter than the bright prospects already priced in. Over the short term of course anything can happen. 
 As the old adage goes, 'a greater fool' may come along who shareholders can sell to at an even higher price.  However if the original purchase price was overvalued, any resulting profits from a sale to such a 'greater fool' would be from what Ben Graham characterised as speculation rather than investment. 

I think it's an interesting reflection on the state of the market today that people who commented earlier pointing out that valuation and earnings matter got down voted - and this in a thread named after Ben Graham's book! After an unusual 10-year stretch of underperformance for value investing, there aren't many true value guys left standing.  They've been getting swamped by momentum type speculators who focus on sales growth and not fundamental value (by fundamental value I mean comparing the net present value of future distributable cash flow per share vs the share price).  Again not saying that's you - I have no idea whether or not it is - but I think those types of speculators are driving the stock prices of the stocks you listed while this growth/momentum/cloud/tech bubble lasts.

gcyob0y;1;"I've been struggling with Slack vs Teams in terms of investment for awhile now. I've used both in the workplace and Slack even for personal use. At the moment, Slack does a much better job at a lot of things that MSFT *has* the ability to implement into Teams, but they just don't have the flexibility and speed to add. Conversely, MSFT very clearly built Teams almost as an all-in-one solution to help connect with their other products & 3rd party products. 

Ultimately I believe that MSFT is in a place to utilize Teams in a way that generates stronger profits than Slack, but at the end of the day it's hard for me to actually choose Teams as a better product over Slack.

In relation to OP's thesis about the bottoms-up approach, it's definitely not wrong. Subjectively speaking, my company's lower level teams adopted both Slack AND Asana early on and then usage expanded to the whole company in the exact way OP described. At the end of the day, they're great products, it's really just a matter of if you think the companies will be able to leverage their platforms into profits. MSFT has already proven their success in that area, but has failed with other products previously(even Google failed with their Social Network so it *does* happen). Slack, on the other hand, still is young and growing, so they have some ways to go before proving they're a real killer. 

If you want my unbridled opinion on Slack, I think that it will eventually be purchased by a big player in the game. It's a great product, with a great team, that is highly desirable in an ever increasing WFH world.";t1_gcwrw56;t3_jxam5x;1605895299.0

In my mind the bull case is that they have managed to bundle quite a few core products into one solution. EG they have CRM, Marketing software, sales software and CMS. And they have managed to build out this broad product offering while keeping the product quality fairly high. This matters because as they go upmarket more, they are going to meet customers who want more consolidation in the tools they use and not to have different providers for everything. They've also managed to keep revenue growth fairly high for a number of years which is a good sign.

The bear case is exactly what you alluded to, they are in a very competitive space and since the product is so broad they have a lot of competitors. EG Zendesk and Salesforce are quite different but both compete with Hubspot.

Many of the top folks at Microsoft got exposure to Buffett (him and Gates are very close) and learned the financial aspects over time. 

> Detailed financial analysis is important but thats definitely not my goal or what I'm trying to focus on with this research. 

You don't necessarily have to be detailed. What you want to do is make sure you know what you're buying. When you buy a stock, it's a part of the firm. You have to make sure you can estimate the value of the entire firm before assigning a value to the stock itself. 

Remember that a stock is a claim on a share of future profits. If the firm will generate $X over time, then it's worth an amount based on whatever $X is. You have to determine what X is in order to estimate what a company or stock is worth.

> If you only judge technology companies based on their past financial performance and don't look at their market, value prop etc then I think you are missing a big piece of the analysis puzzle.

In order to predict future performance, I think it should be grounded in past results. If you predict XYZ to make $100 in profit in 2025, what would you have said in 2015 for 2020? Take the 2015 financial statements and do a test. What do you think the revenue line would be, the expense structure, and so on?

Here's the problem:  It's bundled in a way to specifically ""scam"" you into have to always upgrade to the highest tier, at which point it's quite expensive.

For example, they sell you on X numbers of users, and Y number of contacts, and put forward a plan.  They offer a discount, ok, this looks like it will work.

Our company uses a call center for certain leads, so we want the API from the call center.  The response from hubspot was ""oh, well, to turn on the API you have to be at the highest level of hubspot (I think called enterprise). 

Now, there is no technical reason for this, it's just to suck you in at a lower level and then force you to upgrade later.

I get why they do it from a business perspective, but from our standpoint it was ""oh wait, these guys were pulling a bait and switch on us, so how do we know what the price is really going to be two years from now when our discounted pricing runs out... they have said ""don't worry, we will offer you a decent deal then"" but of course we no longer trusted them to be forthcoming, so we abandoned hubspot.";t1_gcvf3ci;t3_jxam5x;1605882713.0

Sorry I just assumed because you brought up trillions of QE. I see now you were just making the comparison. Yeah I'm not worried at all, with a large stimulus we might have actually met inflation target not get anything like runaway inflation.

Household debt is lower because a little over a third of the $1200 stimulus check went to paying off debt, but as fiscal support dries up as well as regular unemployment insurance running out debt will pick back up. Might wind up a wash but we'll see. I do think households have relatively high debt loads that drag down growth.

>I think it's a secular shift that has brought inflation levels down. We've moved further away from scarcity with a meaningful amount of spending shifting towards goods that can technically have unlimited supply.

I would agree almost completely, but human capital is limited at any given time so demand can still exceed supply. Service workers can still only work so much and it takes time to train for high skill services, which can lead to a supply demand mismatch in the short run.

Well yes, but also no. In terms of CPI you're correct, but the Fed uses Core-PCE which excludes food and energy. Also as the economy transitions away from fossil fuels their prices matter less than say electricity prices during peak usage. As for short term prices crude reserves wont come down until a while after the pandemic is over and even then there's still lots of overcapacity like you said with shale and OPEC.

Seems to me energy prices leak through the price of everything, even if it's not included in Core-PCE.

>Also as the economy transitions away from fossil fuels their prices matter less than say electricity prices during peak usage. 

In 10 years this is probably true, but over the next 3-5 yrs we will still be highly dependent on fuel prices.

>As for short term prices crude reserves wont come down until a while after the pandemic is over and even then there's still lots of overcapacity like you said with shale and OPEC. Also I'm hearing lots of strain in OPEC which does not bode well for potential further supply cuts to buoy prices. Even if Oil heads back over $100 somehow, 

Reserves are already down - there are a material amount of forecasts having us hitting 5-yr averages by YE or Q1/21. I think the strain in OPEC comes from the current price environment, but the fact they've held onto curtailments this long is an indication thins aren't THAT strained. 

Shale overcapacity is overstated though. Capital available for the sector is non existent and banks/investors likely won't be giving out much for cash unless there's clear free cash flow there, which doesn't happen in shale until WTI prices are above $60.  

>I think you'll see capacity expansion in solar and batteries before a new shale boom. 

Depends what your definition of shale boom is. I think we could easily see 1,000-1,500 rigs in the field again if prices got high enough. I don't think we'll see shale production surpass its peak production from last year though, or if it does it won't be a material amount. It's not like it's a 1:1 trade between oil and solar - you'd also have to have a significant rollout of electric cars which is not happening over the next 5 yrs.

I'm on the energy side of things, so that's why I have a different view than most will here. I think people are greatly overestimating how fast shale can backfill what was lost over the past 6 months in oil production due to COVID, and if travel takes off once vaccines start getting rolled out, we could see oil prices move to $60+ very quickly. Anecdotally, some people are the most bullish I've seen on oil in the past 5 years.";t1_gcvtuu9;t3_jx59xp;1605828823.0
gcw2jdr;1;"Energy prices do ""leak"" into everything else for sure, still I can't see energy prices picking up inflation past 2% without a number of other significant inflation tailwinds. If energy prices are high households will adjust budgets lowering consumption demand in other areas, even as those industries also face higher production costs I think the deflationary pressure of slumping demand will at least balance if not still push prices lower, especially with low financing costs.

You've given me a lot to think about here. By boom I was thinking a significant expansion over peak, but you're righ production levels could very well pick back up to near peak levels as soon as next year. I think Jet fuel and maybe some other refined products still have inventory to go through even once travel picks back up, and then there's work from home which is likely to be more prominent in a post covid world. I don't think office workers are going to completely WFH forever, but I could see a lot of jobs going to 2/3 days/week in office and the rest WFH which could prevent gas demand from fully returning. In terms of expansion though even just low levels of free cash flow I don't think would see a ton of capital flow back into the industry, given all the recent trouble I can't see ""probably break even"" being a significant impetus to invest in an industry with medium to long term headwinds like shale, but if prices hold well above break even then I think you'll see capital rush back in. Of course I could be totally wrong here and oil investors always seem to have more risk tolerance than I would think prudent haha";t1_gcvx2y4;t3_jx59xp;1605831700.0

Actually if you read the piece the exact opposite conclusion is reached: that with this move China actually **derisked** its economy and therefore arguably made it safer for investors. It was not a ""move on a whim by Xi because he got his sensitive feelings hurt by Jack Ma"" like so many Western publications argued. Like the piece says:

> [Regulators think that] there are many deficiencies of the current Chinese financial system, but that does not mean “BigTech” gets to do what it wants, even if we can acknowledge their contributions to society.  TL.DR: we like innovation, but let’s not overhype the magic of “big data,” and anyway, you’re still operating in financial services, and so that’s how you’re going to be regulated, like it or not.  That’s because if we the regulators don’t step in, and something goes wrong, who will pay the price?  Society will, the citizens will. Don’t you guys remember the Great Financial Crisis of 2008?  A few parties won, yes, but all the rest of us? We lost.  We were all set back.  That’s not happening again, not on our watch!

When regulators think like that, I think that's a system worth investing into IMHO, because they think long-term and they think greater-good which ultimately leads to a stronger economy, not something to be scared by...

The only argument that can be made, I think, is that they acted too last-minute and that is scary in itself but it is also actually somewhat reassuring because they're not afraid to stop something as iconic as the world's largest IPO when they believe it can ultimately be detrimental to society.

gcqorn4;5;"Haven't dug into the report, but the question I would pose is the following:

&#x200B.

Right now, I contend that universities are *mostly* credentialing mills which, individually, still make sense to attend for most people (though, the ""surplus"" of long-term value created for students is dramatically eroded away by the increased prices of the institutions).

&#x200B.

If this dynamic changes and employers deprioritize a bachelor's degree, to what extent will calculus be necessary for the average person? At my university, all liberal arts majors were required to take a year of foreign language instruction. This isn't a remark about the value of that education, but moreso the acknowledgement that some of the coursework, which at best is designed to provide a diverse set of problem solving skills, and at worst, is busy work to justify expensive college tuition, may not be as relevant in the future.  

Knowing all of the data in the world with respect to how to instruct calculus more effectively, a la Aida, may not be important.  And, if it is important, I am not sure which markets Pearson would be equipped to win compared to other competitors.  Can they beat Duolingo? Possibly, but it's not clear.  

It's not also clear to me why an individual academic, who historically would have worked with the Publisher to gain distribution / publishing ability, would choose to go down the route of working with a Pearson vs. distributing the interaction similarly to a Jordan Peterson example (e.g., Youtube, Podcasts, [Selfauthoring.com](https://Selfauthoring.com), as well as books).  Now, this may portend worse outcomes for most published academics, because their efforts may not justify the cost/benefit equation, so they cease to work with publishers to create book or eBook content, but that doesn't speak to the most popular creators who have an opportunity to capture a disproportionate share of what Pearson had monopolized (Stewart's calculus, to stay with math).";t3_jwjul8;t3_jwjul8;1605722637.0

Whatever AI insights can be repeated probably aren’t worth much in dollars. Universities increase their margins by increasing reputation or up-selling masters degrees and they already inflate grades so not certain what marginally better grades does for them

Not certain what stops Blackboard from getting there first but I don’t know anything about their content business, if any

Educational software is generally shit because the best developers work on things with a higher chance of making them wealthy. Working at Pearson is unlikely to do that and the culture sounds like the polar opposite of what the best talent wants";t3_jwjul8;t3_jwjul8;1605731374.0

\- You think local Wuhan officials were late & dumb in their response to COIVD-19 in Dec/Jan? Compared to New York officials in Feb/Mar, and compared to the US federal government under Trump, they now seem like a model of alacrity and preparedness.

\- There are democracies (Korea, Australia, New Zealand) that managed this pandemic far better than any countries in the ""proper"" West, without resorting to heavy-handed measures. Dismissing the achievements of others as ""Oh, they were just autocratic"" is the geopolitical equivalent of ""But they cheated!"".

\- What herd immunity? COVID-19 immunity obtained from infection doesn't last more than a few months, after which you are fair game for re-infection. Besides, herd immunity requires 60% of the total population to be immune, which means 200 million people for the US. With an official tally of 10 million people infected (probably 2x or 3x that number in real life - yet another reminder of American failure, c. 2020), the US still has a long and arduous march before natural herd immunity is achieved - especially with re-infection in the play.

There is simply no other way to cut this. America and Western Europe completely f\*\*ked this up. Forget being shown up by China, we were shown up by Vietnam and Mongolia.

gco8lad;2;"> initial reaction was (local Wuhan officials) hiding news about the outbreak to keep optics of control

Contrary to popular belief, this is not true at all and demonstrably so. There were 2 so-called ""whistleblowers"" in Wuhan at the time: Dr. Ai Fen and Dr. Li Wenliang (who tragically ended up dying from the virus). What happened is that in the afternoon of 30 December, Ai received the test result from a patient showing infection from a coronavirus. When she saw the words ""SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 types of oral / respiratory colonization bacteria"" on the test sheet, Ai immediately reported to the hospital's public health department and infection department. She circled the word ""SARS"", and took an image of it and sent it to a doctor at another hospital in Wuhan. From there it spread throughout medical circles in Wuhan, where it reached Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the hospital. On the afternoon of the same day, Li sent a warning to former classmates over WeChat, which was reposted publicly in large numbers.

So they blew the whistle on the 30th of December: for how long did those famous ""local Wuhan officials"" subsequently hide the news? Well definitely less than 24 hours since [the WHO picked up a media statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission about this new virus on the 31st of December](https://www.who.int/news/item/29-06-2020-covidtimeline) and then released an international statement about it the same very same day. What's the argument here? That they hid this new virus from the world during a crucial few hours?

> central government used its authoritarian power to control population behavior. Scary that this actually worked.

I've lived through all of it, having not set foot outside China for now a year and a half. What happened was simply an extremely well executed response to the virus by the government. To this day - and this will probably remain the case until I die - the most impressive thing I've seen in my whole life. When it was understood that the virus was highly deadly and contagious, the government raised the alarm and within the space of 24 hours the whole country (1.4 billion people!) changed dramatically: streets emptied, shops emptied and everyone went home. This wasn't so much an ""authoritarian power controlling population behavior"", no-one actually forced us to go back home, this was done organically because we all believed this virus was dangerous and we needed to protect ourselves. Then very quickly measures were taken: within a handful of days there was a general distribution of free masks to the whole population, people checking our temperature everywhere (entrance of shops, metro station, etc.), an app was released with a traffic light system (green, orange, red) to see if we'd come into contact with potentially infected people, massive hospitals that could hold thousands of patients were built in less than 10 days in Wuhan, etc. As a Westerner I was absolutely blown away by the speed and sheer competence of the response. And, of course, most importantly, it worked, we all collectively beat the virus until it totally stopped spreading in China. To this day I don't know a single person who got the virus in China and I don't know anyone who knows anyone who got the virus in China! So, yeah, call it authoritarian power if you wish but living through it I'm extremely glad I was here when the virus struck instead of my native country (France) or any other of the Western countries that totally botched their response.";t1_gcmsy1g;t3_jvgq61;1605662062.0
gdy3tim;1;">initial reaction was (local Wuhan officials) hiding news about the outbreak to keep optics of control - what other bad news could be lurking?, then

From my perspective, there is no way anyone without absolute power can respond correctly in this situation.

If you react correctly to an emerging pandemic, you will be blamed for overreacting because there will be no pandemic and to everyone else you will look like you overreacted for nothing. Basically, you will be blamed for overreacting and then fired.

If you care about your career, the correct move is to wait until you have a mandate to act. This won't happen however until the pandemic really spreads and start panicking people.

The only reason why the Chinese central government can do what it did was become Xi Jinping has absolute power. He won't get fired even if he overreacted. So he can afford to order total national mobilization. In some sense Xi Jinping is incredibly lucky that China failed to contain COVID-19 quickly. If China had completely contained COVID-19, the level of response that Xi ordered would be seen as complete overkill and the world would be laughing at China's ridiculous overreaction to a small flu.

It is only because COVID ended up spreading on a global scale that Xi Jinping's ""overreaction"" in mid-January is seen as the right move in hindsight. If Xi Jinping had ordered the same reaction 2 weeks earlier, we would not be talking about COVID-19 right now, we would be talking about how China's authoritarian government is prone to overreact over tiny things.

In contrast, Trump has to downplay COVID in real time. This is an election year and he cannot afford to overreact the same way Xi did. If he reacted correctly and COVID got contained, he would be blamed for overreacting. The only correct course of action is to tell everyone this is nothing but a flu and wait for events to prove him right and then tell everyone I told you so.";t1_gcmsy1g;t3_jvgq61;1606607660.0

I think US and other Western nations did fuck up response but there was a lot of uncertainty around the origin and nature of the pandemic to shutdown a red-hot economy.  China wasn't forthcoming early on with the information they had about COVID.

Comment on China's authoritarian action was more about how their system works, and in this case worked well. But it was a band-aid solution. Ultimate solution being understanding the origin of the virus and developing treatment and vaccine.  That same authoritarian system could harm their population and the world in other circumstances.  

About the herd immunity comment: US is closer to herd immunity because of previously mentioned fuck-up. US economy would be in better position if we can prioritize vaccine distribution to those most vulnerable and get to herd immunity target. That would allow us to not only open up domestically but also open up to the rest of the world.  Same may not be as easy for China. They have a bigger population to distribute the vaccine to. They might pull it off just as easily, who knows? Would you trust the vaccine Chinese government told you to take? force you to take?
Yes, reinfection is a risk (virus mutation is a bigger risk) but having a vaccine means we have a mechanism to manage. 

BTW, 11.3M reported cases in US. I think there is a lot more asymptomatic cases that went unreported or people who got sick and recovered without getting tested or tested negative after recovering. That, plus this next wave over the fall and winter months surely gets us very close to herd immunity. Not the way we wanna get there I might add.

This is taking our current system for granted.

China does not allow this information to be public, the numbers they release are manipulated. It's a cultural thing. \[Side note : The Chinese (and N.E. Asian languages) have characters with multiple meanings. The Chinese characters for face are  面子 . It's not just your physical face, it's the optics of who you are and, in Chinese society, it is very important to maintain your face.\] So in order to rise so rapidly after being accepted into the WTO, they just straight up lied about a whole plethora topics including their economy to bring in money from the West.

>  If what you're saying is true, the question is, how do they manage to lie about it without anyone noticing? 

People do notice. Markets aren't going to act on it unless it directly affects them. Where money can be made, it will be made. IMO, the best thing the orange man did was heavily scrutinize Chinese markets and Chairman Xi, and he did it for the wrong reasons and got lucky. Low labor jobs are difficult to bring back to the US without reducing labor costs. America shouldn't be focusing on bringing back jobs China is able to do for actual pennies on the dollar. It should, however, focus on market manipulation from the Chinese. One example being generic drugs. China wanted into the drug markets so they built factories and artificially lowered the price of their drugs until it wasn't profitable for US companies to compete. Once most of the generic drugs were produced in China, they upped the price again making the US - and much of the world - reliant on Chinese manufacturing. They also use slave labor, but that's a whole different topic.";t1_gclj9hj;t3_jvgq61;1605621277.0

... fast, secure, and affordable digital payments, as well as on-the-spot consumer credit, is already a solved problem. And now along comes APT, and wants to provide a similar solution at triple the cost. It doesn't make any economic sense. The reason there is so much confusion is that (1) from the consumer perspective, they falsely believe they are saving money (as the APT costs are hidden and incorporated into retailer prices). and (2) many merchants testify that they have benefited from APT, but as discussed, this was due to the early-adopter cannibalisation, and consumption pull-forward effects.

“APT might at first appear to be saving consumers money (and be perceived that way by consumers), but somebody has to pay for this 4%, and that somebody will ultimately be the end consumer, because merchants will have no choice but to raise prices to recoup this 'APT tax'. The bulls attempt to deny this fact, but denials make no economic sense (at scale). Most retailers earn in the vicinity of 5-10% operating margins, and the industry is not going to settle for seeing more than half of its profitability stripped away and passed on to APT.

It doesn't take a particularly deep level of thinking to see that the putative benefits for merchants are a fallacy of composition that don't scale. APT and the bulls are always quick to emphasise that APT allows merchants to boost their sales, but there are only two mechanisms by which this can occur. Firstly, an APT merchant can cannibalise the sales of competitors who do not accept Afterpay. From the consumer point of view, APT is a superior payment option than using a credit card/cash, so if Merchant A accepts APT and competing Merchant B does not, consumers might decide to shop more frequently with Merchant A, allowing Merchant A to pick up market share at Merchant B's expense. However, the benefits of this don't scale. It's only a matter of time before Merchant B decides to accept APT as well, and then the cannibalistic effect disappears, but the 4% transaction fees do not.

The second way APT can boost a merchant's sales is by providing consumers with yet another means by which to outspend their income. If a customer lacks the cash or credit card balance to purchase item X, without APT they will have to go without. With APT, they can now 'afford' to buy it. While in the short term this will indeed boost merchants' sales, the ultimate effect is merely to pull forward consumers' purchases, and so in the long term drives no sustained benefit.”";t1_gcjwcpj;t3_jv888b;1605569741.0
gcj2k6w;5;"It's fun to point to the tech bubble two decades ago, when things have massively changed since then. The internet was in the infancy, and the infrastructure those businesses needed to justify those multiples simply didn't exist. That's not true now. The other difference is, how long can you say ""yeah, but look at the tech bubble, it's happening again!"" when people have been saying that for 10+ year? It's time to accept things are different, because things DO change.

Back then, there were no playbooks like we have now to monetization or the distribution, internet speed, etc. Everyone points to past crises to say 'look how bad this is!!! It's happening again', but the odds of being sideswiped by something that familiar in our memories is very small.

Some thoughts and a suggestion:  
1. Buffett didn't back Hilary because she was expected to win, but because she more aligned with his principles (he doesn't just role with the crowds). He actually financially benefited more from a Trump pres.  
2. Trump's electoral college win was not a black swan event, it was predictable, but you're right, low probability. I agree COVID was.  
3. It's not necessarily true that in order to make profits long-term you *need* to go against the herd and only take unpopular positions. Defining ""herd"" is tricky. But the herd (common perception) could be right about a business and it can still have more room to run. Intrinsic value can increase over time. I'd argue that you need to find mispriced securities (price and intrinsic value are divergent). And contrarianism can indeed be very profitable but usually at extremes.  
Everybody has their own style, but I'd suggest not having performance as your primary focus. The market is not so obliging nor predictable so you ""attain that performance no matter what."" Margin of Safety, focusing on probabilistic events with good risk/return and downside protection is great, don't get me wrong, but relying on history as your input and vowing to ""not lose money"" (great in theory, impossible in practice) might be troublesome. History is not predictive of the future, which is what investing is all about. Then you start delving into value factor territory rather than value investing.

I can't read ""And now, it’s just a matter of time before the performance of ARM-based chips continues its march upmarket into Intel’s last refuge: the server business"" without immediately thinking that he has no idea of the very long and tumultuous history of big iron server ARM. Apple's lighting core is not going to be in the datacenter/server space. Ever. That's not how Apple works. They keep their vertically integrated tech as a competitive advantage and as a way to gate in innovation from other players that literally don't have the capability to copy it without playing ""follow the leader"", the cadence of which works to Apple's advantage.

If ARM stays independent then ARM is not breaking into servers any time soon. If NVIDIA gets ARM then it is highly likely that ARM will be in servers, but that's just the progression of the trend that's already happening with stream processing eating x86 market share. NVIDIA will not be slotting in ARM chips into chip sockets currently owned by Xeon and Threadripper, they have a very different vision for the datacenter and server space that involves deep vertical integration and dominant performance to justify it. Thus their purchase of Mellanox as a means to that end.

Intel is not screwed because of Apple (we've known about Apple ARM for many months now), it still comes down to AMD getting into the datacenter, server, and laptop space - areas where Intel has built it's behemoth size off of parts that they sell for thousands of dollars. Margins will be crushed, and Intel has insanely huge capex requirements due to running its own fabs. If Intel continues to have fab problems and has to execute an inevitably expensive transition to fabless while their margins are getting crushed, it's going to be another inflection point where investors are going to bail. That would probably be the buy-in time for a knife catcher, but I'd never buy it now. Their quarterly reports are so poor right now that every report has a serious risk of huge investment losses. Intel lied to investors for years about the severity of their fab problems, and Swan gets 0 leeway from investors. I remember how awful his first call was, how he was trying to blame China and how outright pissed the analysts were at his bullshit and how huge the resulting selloff was afterwards. It's really an important point that Intel has lost the trust of their investors, including institutions. These bad flow trends aren't going to reverse unless Intel perhaps kills it for a couple of quarters back to back, and that's not at all likely given the competitive landscape.";t3_ju7tdx;t3_ju7tdx;1605404950.0
gcbkz5h;10;"All the articles that come out that I see on Intel focus on CPU. CPU is one part of the whole stack (although the main one today) and I think this is where there's a mismatch between what Intel is seen as today and what they can be if they ""figure it out"" and keep discussing in their presentations and calls.

That is, if they can solve the various CPU-GPU-FPGA-etc bottlenecks all of this individual unit performance will be noise against the huge leaps forward of the whole stack. 

It's relatively early in this transformation but starting to see some results:
The recent release of the mobile gaming servers adopted by Tencent is pretty impressive and extremely competitive, for example, squashing the next-best setup from NVDA. oneAPI, which is available in a couple of weeks, is an ambitious attempt to unseat CUDA and really tie all the parts together (I have my doubts this will make a difference, but they do recognize the potential for this to be a game changer and devs seem to be welcoming the effort).

A lot has to go right for this transformation to an AI juggernaut to work, but probably can't count Intel out just yet. LEAPs perhaps for 2023 (or 2024 when they come out) are a good way to play this imo. Super cheap and roughly when the tide would shift when it either works or doesn't.

gcdm1e1;5;"I'm short on Intel via longer-dated puts.

My impression is that Intel's fantastic margins (% and volume) were the result of high yield and volume of very efficient and depreciated/amortized 14nm capex and R&D at monopoly pricing power.  

But as AMD has made Intel's 14nm increasingly irrelevant with Zen 2 and 3 for DC, mobile, and desktop, Intel will be forced to jump to their 10nm burning platform which will have less volume at worse yields and thus at much worse margins for an overall inferior product. 2021 and 2022 are going to be awful for Intel's margins while they hope that news that 7nm is competitive and on time will inspire confidence among investors, partners, and customers who have to be pretty cynical about Intel's roadmap execution by now. This is the value trap of looking at Intel's historical margins and cash flow, especially if you don't account for the customer emergency buying caused by covid-19 and compensating for Intel security mitigations. Covid-19 was a godsend for Intel and is probably the only reason they will meet initial FY20 guidance.

And that's just the short to medium term. Medium to long-term, x86 as the dominant compute platform seems to be near its peak and will have some major challenges from more customized solutions from customers who have ambition and scale. That's not a big deal if you're AMD eating your way up and have a few synergies to work with. Not good for Intel who has the most to lose if ""the one ISA to rule them all"" scenario deteriorates.

But the biggest problem for Intel to me is their fab situation. What was once a tremendous strength has now become a huge liability. They own these massive fabs whose main function was to crank out x86 chips in a highly coupled way with their design. 10nm is a bad node. 7nm is having a rocky start.

* Do you just ride out the storm and hope that 7nm will save the day...eventually? That's a lot of years of pain. By the time it gets up to volume, what does AMD + TSMC look like? What about competing compute architectures? 
* Do you contract out some x86 to a foundry? Ok, so you're going to pay for the external foundry \*and\* your fabs for x86? The design is tightly coupled to the manufacturing node. How long does it take to hack your design to fit a new foundry's node? Who even has the capacity that is willing to work with you on this? How long will it take? TSMC isn't going to make a material x86 commitment to Intel and weaken AMD while Intel keeps a potential x86 manufacturing base. In the short-term, TSMC's capacity has already been bought up.
* Do you spin off the fabs and have the spin off make x86? But they've already shown that they're not really good enough. Who's going to be buying them and making them better? How much money will you have to cough up to get someone to take the risk of competing against TSMC? How big is that write-off going to be with bazillions in capex and thousands of headcount? How long is this going to take?
* Do you lean on the US government to bail you out and anoint you as some sort of national champion for national security reasons and subsidize your becoming a foundry and then simply force companies to use you if they want to supply strategic US markets?

Regardless of what happens, I doubt you'll ever see 2019 Intel margins again unless 7nm is just fantastic. My wild ass guess is that Intel will go for the 7nm hail mary for x86 because the other scenarios are just too painful and uncertain. In the coming quarters, you'll see lots of operating margin pressure across products as the subpar 10nm volume, yield, and poor competitive positioning become the new normal. Intel can still capture the low to medium end with 14nm maybe, but that's some thin gruel. Swan will provide as much cover as possible and be a good soldier / scapegoat until Intel cans him in mid 2021 and then tries to buy time with their new PhD CEO (""look, we have one too!"") The CEO will preach how this will be a long-term turnaround. If it doesn't look like 7nm going to pan out, they'll spin off its x86 related fabs to a joint venture spinoff with say Samsung and take a huge writedown. 

Maybe Intel's other ventures will strike gold like MobileEye. But that's a lot of x86 dollars at risk. Maybe they'll spin it off ""to focus on their core business."" Barring an incredible 7nm reveal, the Intel of 2024 will be much smaller than the Intel of today.";t3_ju7tdx;t3_ju7tdx;1605439441.0

gcbpt63;9;"> Seems fairly uninformed.

Agreed.  I also had issues with the analysis of the Intel refusal of Apple's request.  Seems pretty straight forward, Intel estimated it wasn't going to make money.  Going up another 100x just sounds like they would lose money faster.  More critical was whatever flawed process led to the bad estimate, but that's not ""dictating to customers"".  No good business sells things that lose it money.

I'm also very curious to actually see some benchmarks of the new M1 systems.  It's one thing to run some processors in a vacuum, it's very different to see this actually happen in real life.  So far there are no benchmarks, which makes me wonder.

I also found it interesting that the author omitted the entire DEC Alpha saga, in the late 90s.  A competitor had a better chip, on a niche OS, and yet failed to dominate either the desktop, or workstation markets.  The parallels are interesting to say the least.  Apple might be in a somewhat better position than DEC, but this is not a new bit of disruption, yet the author presents Intel as this massive juggernaut, until it's not, and the truth is like a lot of companies they've had problems in the past, and will in the future.  Heck, Intel and AMD have swapped places multiple times performance wise as well.

The author also carefully sidestepped how niche Apple is currently.  It was about 5% of Intel's income, and maybe 10% of the PC market.  It's been bouncing along at about the same size for the past decade, and doesn't seem to be posed to change anytime soon.

He also seems to have omitted a discussion of ARM based systems in the past, and the problems with getting people to switch to them.

gcy1fyp;1;"Trade my own book.

Yes, I've followed semis for a couple of decades, although only had personal skin in the game when AMD executed its turnaround. Following Intel was of course important when that trade was open.

It is a fun and in depth space to follow. Semis have a strong cyclical component and are quite trend driven, so investors benefit from looking beyond numbers. For example, I literally ought NVDA around 2005 because GPU compute was looking promising vs traditional CPUs in the server/datacenter space. It took 10+ years for that trend to hit the balance sheet. NVDA was 15 bucks at the time, and no, the trade wasn't kept open for 15 years!

Likewise for AMD hiring Jim Keller who previously took AMD to serer market share with Opteron. In hindsight it was obvious that anyone in the space should had a figurative (or literal) call option on the story repeating itself with Zen architecture.

If I was new to the space I'd dig in to the China semi space. Over the next 10 years there will be huge opportunities there. Yes that does mean pricing out and hedging China specific risks, learning the political forces at play, etc, but a majority of investors block out the region entirely and thus there is opportunity. The next big AI accelerator startup or cloud provider may be a more accessible opportunity vs the US market where VC funding rounds pump valuations meteorically high before going public.

gcelsrx;2;"Thanks for the interesting write-up. No doubt there is money to be made on recovery stocks - I guess it’s more a matter of which sectors will recover fastest and when the recovery will take its next leg up. Those are the two things I would pick at here before considering to start a position in Dufry.

1) Dufry specific: you mention current sentiment leans toward a swift recovery in travel...is this actually true when it comes to air travel? I used to think so, now I’m not so sure. 

Forget about the dangers of getting covid for a second and that we won’t be able to 99% safely fly for still another 6 months or year or so. I am referring to the demise of business travel. This accounts for what - 40-50% of all air travel? Do we really think companies will go back to in-person meetings all the time when zoom and Teams have worked so well? I’m not sure

Note that I guess this isn’t Dufry specific but more air travel (likely hotels as well)

2) Recovery Timing: here is more of a short-term thing. I have been in many recovery stocks and sold many off this week after the big vaccine news. I think it’s likely we are going down more before riding the next wave up - with the European lockdowns, US cases, etc. I don’t see positive catalysts in the coming weeks. I don’t have a crystal ball though so would be interested to hear others opinions.";t3_ju2hlv;t3_ju2hlv;1605460687.0
gcf896e;1;"Thanks for posting! I am invested in Autogrill and Sixt VZ as my travel recovery plays. Autogrill operates restaurants at airports and motorways. My personal experience when travelling back in August was that the restaurants were busy as ever at the Amsterdam airport, while duty free shops remained mostly closed. Granted this is at a hub airport when many direct flights are cancelled. 

Did you take a comparative look at Autogrill by chance? I took a look at some fundamentals but don't have this many tools on my toolbox.";t3_ju2hlv;t3_ju2hlv;1605472384.0
gceyh55;2;"Cheers for weighing in ! So, in terms of ""sentiment"" I was referring mostly to the pop travel stocks have experienced in the past week (weeks for Dufry). Whether airport executives share the market's enthusiasm is another matter - probably not until results materialise. Secondly, the demise of business travel is definitely a big concern for not just the airlines, but all ancillary services. Dufry will no doubt suffer somewhat from this, in terms of sales, but strives to scale-up via acquisitions and JVs will ease the pain. Definitely something I should look more into so thanks for bringing it up 👍 Completely agree on point 2). I believe those wishing to get into Dufry would be wise to wait for a dip in valuation, as in a Worst case scenario I project a price per share of CHF 40 by 2024 so one would in-fact lose money.";t1_gcelsrx;t3_ju2hlv;1605467380.0

gcf17of;1;"What I do find more unusual/compelling about potentially getting into Dufry is that as you mention their revenue/profit has been increasing since 2017 but their share price during this time frame has declined. E.g potentially they were undervalued even before covid. 

I am not sure of the reason but I guess this could be due to a few things, which you also touch upon.

One possibility that stands out to me, and maybe a reason to consider sitting on the sidelines, it looks like growth was much higher from 2010 to 2016 then during the past few years. 

Does this mean the recent acquisitions have not been as strong?

Or perhaps they have reached a stage where they have less possibilities for acquisitions and the underlying growth rate of this industry is quite low? 

On the other hand, perhaps the share price drop has to do with the increasing debt for these acquisitions, in which case covid is not exactly helping them to generate cash to pay off debt, indeed the opposite as you point out.";t1_gceyh55;t3_ju2hlv;1605468791.0
gcflpnf;2;You're right, but this is also mentioned above (Section 2, 1st paragraph). Share price doesn't reflect growth in revenue or EBITDA, because all cash generated from Operations is being consumed by their debt repayments (cash from financing, on Cash Flow Statement). I also explore another option, how investors (recognising this is a cyclical) vacated the stock as soon as organic revenue growth has slowed.;t1_gcf17of;t3_ju2hlv;1605479193.0
gc4ubnl;87;"Key points:

1. China's GDP growth is not an apples-to-apples comparison with other countries, because their banks don't write down bad assets. they just keep rolling the debt forward indefinitely. If those bad assets were impaired as per international standards, they could be up to 40% below official data.

2. China's phenomenal growth since reopening its economy in the 70's was largely because its economy badly needed repairing at the time, after 50 years of anti-Japanese war, civil war and Maoism - so if you just threw money at something it would be productive. Now it has reached a plateau with regards to investment-based growth, and needs to tackle institutional reform - i.e. reform in regulation, education, innovation, etc - in order to spur the next paradigm of growth. That is going to be much harder for an authoritarian government to achieve than simply throwing money at the problem, because the constituencies which benefited the most from investment-based growth and have ended up the most powerful today, i.e. businesses/municipalities, are unlikely to want to let go of that power in order to allow that change to happen.

3. Households tend to be the main driver of GDP growth, because the rich tend to conserve most of their wealth rather than spend it. Most countries have 75% of their wealth owned by households, with the remaining 25% of wealth split between businesses and government. China's split of wealth between the two is 50:50. And even among the households, most of the wealth is concentrated among wealthy households. So without the aforementioned institutional reforms, which the rich and powerful are likely to resist, continued GDP growth is going to be that much harder to achieve.

4. Capital controls are ultimately ineffective, because wealthy Chinese have learned ways to overcome it. E.g. buy subsidized oil in China, send it by the truckloads to the Thai border, bribe the guards there, and sell the oil at spot prices in Thailand. This will continue to put pressure on the RMB exchange rate, which will further deplete already depleting reserves and restrict monetary policy autonomy, i.e. the impossible trinity dilemma.

5. In the 60's, everyone thought the Soviet Union would become a superpower. In the 80's, everyone thought Japan would become a superpower. At the time, they were both economically robust and technologically equal to the USA. But their growth was mainly driven by investment capital not human capital, which meant that their high debt levels needed to get higher in order to sustain growth. China is in the same position today.

6. Conclusion: China still has levers to pull, and in the short-term there is little risk of a crisis-level collapse. But in the long-term it may end up becoming like Japan, with many lost decades to make up for the managed growth of the past.

Clearly wrong. You don't go from producing cheap trinkets to being a leader in 5G and AI without major improvements in human capital.

<1% of young Chinese went to college back in 1980, today that figure is 40%. There will be an explosion of innovation coming from China over the next generation due to the massive pool of well educated young people coming out of the pipeline.

What is often missed is that the one child policy enabled Chinese families to concentrate a ton of resources on their only child. The qualitative difference between Chinese human capital of the next generation and the rest of the world will show up in economic data over the next 50 years. It's easy for people who like to look in the rear view mirror to miss this. A preview of the coming innovation gap between China and the rest of the world can be seen in the gap in PISA scores.

gc7h4ac;9;"Response to his points:

1. Pettis has always been obsessed with ""debt"" in China. He managed not to embarrass himself completely like Gordon G Chang by being repeatedly wrong, or Kyle Bass by losing billions of his clients money, but he's made some projections of debt crises in China that have never come to fruition. NPLs, shadow banking, total debt, etc. It keeps metamorphosing, but he's been consistently wrong on on debt wrt to Chinese growth. Second, he goes in depth in the ways in which Chinese GDP may be overexaggerated, but not the tons of ways its also undercounted for a lack of ""apples to apples"" comparisons. They don't do imputations, they don't do substitutions, they don't do hedonic adjustments. They also don't count huge parts of the service economy, don't even pay attention to most small local-level transactions, ignore a lot of cross-border trade, etc.
2. Why didn't other war-torn countries boom, then? The reality is that Mao, while making many disastrous decisions, did lay some decent groundwork for growth. It took India up until the 2010s to reach China's life expectancy and literacy rate under Mao.
3. Household wealth among the ""lower classes"" is grossly understated. As is household consumption and total wealth. If you look into the data you'll see that the Chinese bottom 10% is the least indebted, their millennials have the highest home-ownership rates, there's little economic discrepancies based on ethnicity, women are closer to parity with men in business ownership, self-made billionaires, top level management, etc.
4. So is China authoritarian or not? Can they keep their people under total control or is it just a free for all?

Bloomberg

 SoftBank has lifted the lid for the first time on “SB Northstar”, the new unit set up to play the market in tech stocks, and revealed that it has racked up trading losses of $3.7bn so far. Until now, SoftBank has shrouded the unit in secrecy, declining to say who was in charge of the unit or what its decision-making process was, after the FT revealed that it was the so-called “Nasdaq whale” buying billions of dollars of derivatives on US tech stocks over the summer. On Wednesday, however, SoftBank said that Akshay Naheta, a 39-year-old former Deutsche Bank trader now based in Abu Dhabi, manages SB Northstar, which is registered in the Cayman Islands. SoftBank executives previously told the FT that Mr Naheta was not formally in charge. Learn More Mute Abu Dhabi company records show that Mr Naheta and his former Deutsche Bank colleague Rajeev Misra, the head of SoftBank’s $100bn Vision Fund, became directors of this fund management unit in July but that Mr Misra stepped down in early September.

 Mr Naheta has a reputation for complex derivatives trades, last year masterminding SoftBank’s controversial bet on the shares of Wirecard, the now collapsed payments company. SB Northstar’s trades are cleared by a three-member investment committee composed of Masayoshi Son, Mr Naheta and Ron Fisher, SoftBank’s vice-chairman.  While Mr Naheta manages Northstar, people close to the trades said Mr Son was the driving force behind the US tech investments. The SoftBank founder has also told investors that he was deeply involved in running the trades. How big are Northstar’s trades?  SoftBank said in August that it was planning to invest about $10bn in publicly traded tech stocks as a way to diversify a portfolio that is heavily reliant on shares in Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba.  

But by the end of September, Northstar had purchased nearly $17bn of shares in US tech companies, including $6.3bn in Amazon, $2.2bn in Facebook, $1.8bn in Zoom and $1.4bn in Alphabet.  It invested another $3.4bn in equity derivatives. The trades included “long call options” — bets on rising stock prices that provide the right to buy stocks at a preset price on future dates — that were worth $4.7bn by the end of September. It also traded “short call options”, that assume falling stock prices, that SoftBank booked as $1.3bn in liabilities. Northstar also held short future contracts on stock indices, which were valued at minus $697m. Some of the bearish positions it took were hit as US tech shares rose during the three months to September, resulting in SoftBank booking derivatives losses totalling $2.7bn.

 The total loss for Northstar reached $3.7bn for the quarter, including $900m in unrealised valuation losses on investments made by the unit.  Market participants who have followed SoftBank’s big US tech trades closely believe the group switched to long call options after the tech rally in late summer to reduce its risk ahead of the US election, and are now going back into buying equities. In its investor presentation, SoftBank also stated how much impact these derivatives trades could have on pre-tax profits. A 30 per cent rise in the stocks that Northstar bet on would have boosted its long call options by $14bn, but seen its short call options lose $5.7bn. A 30 per cent fall in the stock price, meanwhile, would have hit its long call options by $4.3bn but boosted its short call options by $1.2bn. How much firepower does Northstar have?

 When SoftBank announced the existence of the asset management unit in August, it stated that its initial capital would be $555m, with a third of this coming from funds contributed by Mr Son himself. But Northstar has far larger firepower at its disposal, because it uses loans of cash and publicly traded securities from SoftBank’s vast balance sheet to make investments in publicly listed stocks.  SoftBank revealed on Wednesday that, at the end of September, Northstar managed $21bn of its $43bn cash pile, which has swelled as the group has executed a series of asset sales under pressure from activist investors such as Elliott Management.

 Last month, the unit also took out a margin loan of $6bn using SoftBank’s shares in Alibaba.  What other trades is Northstar carrying out? While SoftBank’s $100bn Vision Fund was set up to make equity investments in private technology companies, the new Northstar unit makes trades in publicly listed companies. It has the ability to take both long and short positions, in a similar manner to a hedge fund. SoftBank this week described the new unit’s primary business as to “frequently trade marketable securities”. Northstar has a $4.1bn short position on credit markets, although it is unclear if this is an outright bet against corporate debt markets or a hedge against one of its other positions. It also invests in new equity issued by public companies. Norwegian educational software company Kahoot! announced last month that it had raised $215m-equivalent by selling new shares to SoftBank, which a person familiar with the transaction said had been carried out by Northstar. Mr Naheta has a history of carrying out arbitrage transactions in the shares of companies. Before joining SoftBank in 2017, the Indian trader managed a small London hedge fund, whose profitable trades included a bet that the prices of two classes of shares at India’s Tata Motors would converge. How risky are these trades?  SoftBank executives, particularly Mr Son, have played down the risks posed by its foray into short-term trading of highly liquid stocks, saying the investments amount to only 7 per cent of its total equity holdings worth $292bn.  

The gains and losses from the options trades fluctuate all the time. In early September, SoftBank was sitting on gains of about $4bn. That turned to a $2.7bn loss as of end September but the losses may have reversed by now.  But analysts remain nervous, noting that Mr Son has $50bn in cash following the disposal of SoftBank’s stakes in T-Mobile, Alibaba and its domestic telecoms arm.  “SoftBank Group’s motivations are not clear,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal said. “For such a long-term investor as Mr Son, we don’t understand the attraction of short-term call spreads.” Mr Son has argued that his group cannot ignore the Big Tech if it wants to bet on the future of artificial intelligence. “The real frontrunner in the AI revolution is Gafa (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon). We need to put them into our portfolio.”";t1_gc13i0r;t3_jsrkqt;1605177517.0

The CDX is made up of  100 investment grade issuers, and each time any of them defaults over the next 5 years, the protection buyer receives a payment. There is a liquid market for CDX so the market value moves before any default materialises.

The bet is similar to LQD puts in that they have an asymmetric payoff (small premium(s) for a potentially big payoff) and they both refer to investment grade corporate issuers. The main difference is that LQD is sensitive to interest rates on top of credit, whereas CDX is a pure credit bet.";t1_gc1l4fi;t3_jsrcb0;1605203674.0
gc2haap;1;"Thanks! 

A question: suppose the default spread on the underlying bonds is 4%, and the interest rates are 1% and don't change. If you enter such a contract, and then the default spread compresses to 2% (interest rates still at 1%), what's the max loss here? In the case of LQD puts you'd lose all the option premium. In the CDX variant how long will you have to be paying the now significantly inflated premium? Would you be obligated to bleed the premium for the next 5 years?";t1_gc2emb4;t3_jsrcb0;1605204710.0
gc37qoi;3;"A very rough estimate of the credit duration (sensitivity) will be the time to maturity, in this case I'm guessing 5 years if it's the newest CDX series. So if the credit spread compresses 2%, the loss would be 2% \* 5 = 10% of the notional, and you could exit the position at that loss, or keep paying the premiums until maturity. It will be the opposite in the other direction.

In this case with spreads being at 49bps, the downside feels limited as you would have a hard floor at 0, and it'd be hard to even get close to 0. Whereas an upwards move of 100bps is very possible, as it is what happened in March.";t1_gc2haap;t3_jsrcb0;1605216800.0

While the idea of putting people into re-education camps look bad, it is better to put ideas in their heads than bullets. It is deeply ingenuous to criticise the Chinese solution when western powers are engaging in active military action killing and bombing these same communities. Uighurs were first condemned by the US as terrorists and many of them remain in Guantanamo Bay.

There are Uighurs that have came out of these camps who pick up the Chinese language and integrating in Chinese society, while they can still use their own native tongue when they want. Everywhere in the world, there is a need to integrate people into society. The Uighurs otherwise face huge economic difficulty if not for this pathway, so while not ideal looks to be a better solution than simply letting them languish and fall to further radicalisation.

The increased rate of retirement is more than offset by the cyclical trends of aging fleets. The mid-2010s saw historic highs of aircraft deliveries, and those airplanes are aging into out-of-warranty during the next 5 years, which drives aftermarket revenue as a result. We've compiled all airplane deliveries over the last 40 years by the main OEMs to get a gauge over aircraft fleet and we're confident that the accelerating growth in the airplanes aged 6-15 cohort more than offsets accelerated retirements (also, many of these retirements were merely accelerated and over the long-term have little/no impact on TDG - it just shifts some of the slowdown in revenue onto this year).";t1_gbxrst5;t3_js5nlo;1605133984.0

As far as on the aftermarket side - even if an individual airline goes under, we're not super concerned because someone will still own & fly those planes, especially given that those planes are often leased from lessors anyways.

I take issue with the claim that these pants ""revolutionised"" women's fashion - women were wearing light black leggings years before Lululemon was founded.

He states that the secret sauce of the leggings is the 81% nylon / 19% lycra mix, which is either the exact same composition as the cycling shorts I was wearing in 1993, or very close indeed to it (within 1% or 2%).

The reason why Nike has had lots of companies eating their lunch is because they are a large company, large companies grow fat and lazy, they migrate towards expensive and wasteful marketing, and they don't think growth in small categories matters (until the small category becomes a large one). These days it is possible to market effectively with a marketing budget of close to zero, no team sponsorship, no player sponsorship, etc. This is what LULU did, this is what many other companies are doing (LULU are actually a bit behind the times now, ecomm brands are growing much faster at lower cost).";t1_gbutl5x;t3_jrm6bj;1605043507.0

gbqyc5a;44;I got into FIG because I really liked the idea of using an insurance company's float as investing dry powder (e.g. Fairfax, Berkshire, etc.) but ended up specializing in banks. I don't personally find banks dry because they're so influence by the macro environment (interest rates in particular) so you can build quite a dynamic mental model for yourself which is fascinating (to me). Banks can differentiate themselves in a few ways: their funding mix (deposits vs. debt vs. equity. all of these can be further subdivided), their investment portfolio, their loan mix (commercial real estate vs. commercial & industrial vs. residential, etc.), their revenue mix (interest income vs. advisory vs. investment income, etc.), their brick and mortar vs. online strategy, etc. The core business model of a bank is accumulating funds and using them to provide loans. The key to a successful bank is balancing the risk/return of its loan portfolio, cheap funding (such as low cost deposits), maintaining healthy capital ratios, a differentiated revenue stream (such as an investment banking business unit), and an online strategy that reduces the brick and mortar cost over time.;t1_gbqpwvf;t3_jr26cn;1604950095.0

The bank model works because banks “borrow” short term and lend long term. When the yield curve is normal (upward sloping), short term rates are lower than long term rates which means banks’ cost of funding would be lower than the yield it realizes on its loans - this is how they get a spread. The yield curve is the most “normal” in a rising rate environment which is why bank stocks did so well in 2016/2017 but have been crushed since the Fed dropped rates.

Asset management companies are valued based on the revenue streams from the underlying assets under management, generally split into a stabile management fee (% of AUM) and a more volatile performance fee (% of investment profits above a hurdle rate). Management fees carry a higher valution multiple since they are consistent and independent of performance, which is why most AMs have turned into asset gatherers.

EBIT margins are usually pretty stabile once they reach scale, since most AMs require incremental employees per $ AUM. From there it’s a simple EV/EBIT or P/E multiple, but you could do a DCF too.";t1_gc56oom;t3_jr26cn;1605277086.0

Generally, cost of sales are expenses directly relating to the company’s products. Operating expenses deals with expenses to support the core business function such as G&A (payroll expenses etc), sales and marketing etc. 

The picture you posted seems to be from the footnotes of “other expenses”. Assuming it is so, generally “other expenses” do not relate to the core business (thus not cogs nor operating expenses).

And now that Marc Rubinstein has pointed it out, I don't see why the market exists in its current form. Perhaps if the government stepped out completely rates would rise to a much higher natural spread over money rates.

The other big thought is that the seeds of 2008 were sown in the 1940s and 1950s. Perhaps the reason it didn't melt down sooner is that residential American real estate has been a kind of Ponzi scheme for the last 80 years. Rising values of land and building materials provide profits to mortgagors, and debt enhances that profit. Those profits are slow to metastasize into problems because the recycling rate of that money tends to be on a long cycle. Homeowners can sit on profits in a fully paid off property for 5, 10, 25 years. Years 2000-2008 were huge boom years for real estate prices and HELOCs, and that injected a lot of potential instability. People who didn't know how to gauge the risk of buying an expensive house(s) got in over their heads.

I'll stop speculating there since I don't know the non-American mortgage markets, and can't make further comparisons to finish the insights. (Except that I'll say Iceland has a strange system.)";t3_jq2ksx;t3_jq2ksx;1604904143.0

Row 33 is labeled margin, looks like it should say growth. Is it realistic for PLTR to grow revenue 40%+ but only grow opex lines at 2% y/y over the next several years? I haven't done any work on this one yet but that seems really unlikely to me.

Why is growth slowing down so much in 2H20? . Is that typical for them or did they guide to that or something? On the other side of that, CY19 revenue only grew 25% and you have forecast years sustaining 40% y/y growth, seems aggressive but maybe there's a good reason behind that.

Someone else sorta touched on this but it doesn't make sense to drop to a terminal growth rate of 3% after a few years of sustained 40%+ growth... You may want to consider building a 3 stage DCF so that you can more gradually ratchet the growth to 3%.

A more detailed revenue build up is not  really possible with this company as they dont provide a lot of info. This is as deep as you can go.



4. That is the long term growth rate. Long term growth rate in theory cant exceed the economy's growth, otherwise it would ""outgrow"" it.

Thanks for responding on CoD. it makes sense from an academic PoV but I would be surprised to see PLTR borrowing at such high rates in the real world.

gblbiy6;5;"I'm going to give comments on the model more generally, but I think r/Sir_Meowstro is being overly harsh on him. Sure if my analyst gave me this as a model, I'd tell them to find a template and please start over, but if this is just for amateur self interest in what's going on in Palantir, then I wouldn't begrudge this too much. I've had interns do much worse. 

1. Don't forget transaction comps are used from an M&A perspective + synergies. Clearly OP isn't buying out the company any time soon, so if all he's interested in is the share price today, trading comps is far more relevant metric to help sense check his numbers. I do agree he should have some simple comp sheet with at least EV / EBITDA and PE multiples to sense check this one (no idea what Palantir's comps are though).

2. I don't understand your point on 5 quarters to forecast 5 annual periods. I've done IBD for 5 years and I've never heard of such a 'rule' that you need to balance out years of historicals with years of forecasts. Hell, this gigantic model I've done for a PE client forecasts out to FY2030 and we only have 3 years of historicals, and the sellside won't give us older data. There is no reason why a 2016 historical numbers should have relevance to FY2021 or 2022 if the company has changed significantly since then. 

3. Balance sheet is overrated in a pure valuation model. You know as well as I do that you just straight line the vast majority of the balance sheet items, and the only things to change are Net Debt, PPE, Intangibles (if any), CA and CL lines and equity, and even then you can ignore the equity cause it doesn't really impact your valuation anyway. I have no problem with ignoring the balance sheet when it comes to a simple valuation model.

For the model itself:

1. I intensely dislike the Capex = D&A, it's a very lazy assumption that ignores the timing difference in investment and D&A catches up over time. r/Galagonya, you have 45% and 35% growth in the 2 divisions, there is no possibility that D&A = Capex in your 5 forecast year. Even then, I would put Capex as >100% of D&A for Terminal period (maybe 105 - 110%) depending on the industry itself. My Autos MD shouted my ear off when he saw I equalised Capex = D&A and he was absolutely right. 

2. Your future share prices are incorrect. They assume Net Debt stays completely the same from FY19-25. I know some brokers assume this as well, but what you should do is, as Sir_Meowstro says, build out your cash flow, which will give you the change in cash, and flow that into your Net Debt line. That way, your share price moves with your cash build up.

3. Row 104, I don't think I've seen this way of building up EV before, this is...unusual. 

4. Row 123-124 - these should be data tables, no need to hardcode them in. 

5. Row 129 - why are you dividing Equity Value by Sales to get a Sales multiple? Need to be EV / Sales. 

6. Ditto on the LT growth point, Not comfortable with your company going from 35-45% CAGR down to 3% CAGR, just lengthen it out to like 2030 and trend it down. There is a formula where you can assume a trend down to your 3%,but I can't remember it from the CFA books tbh.";t1_gbl4y6x;t3_jq08mr;1604830486.0

I can't make sense of yours and the lack of formatting and structure makes this model incredible shoddy at first sight. A DCF should have a tear sheet, a revenue build, annual and quarterly historicals/projections, comparables, and a valuations tab - not to mention a beta calculation. You have 2.3 / 6 of those. 

Again, that is an incorrect way to do intrinsic valuation. What weights are you going to use? What are you going to base those weights on? By using different weights you can get any magical number you want as ""value"". In fact at that point you are just trying to price but even that is done incorrectly. As for the historicals and the revenue build, again, this is as deep as you can go with the info they have provided. Again, there is a beta calculation (see the bottom of the file). 




>I can get them lacking financial history due to just recently going public, but you're missing 2 of the 3 statements. Your balance sheet is insanely consolidated. You should have done a [Precedent Transaction analysis](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/precedent-transaction-analysis/) instead and given your supposed M&A background this shouldn't be an issue. 

No one forecasts balance sheets unless they have guidance from management for it (eg. In m&a). Are you suggesting you can forecast how large a company's PPE is going to be 5 years into the future based on a company's Q reports? Btw, the balance sheet is as detailed as they go in their SEC filings. Precedent transaction analysis to value a publicly traded company? The only case you would use that is if you had an m&a case.

gblldm8;1;">1. I intensely dislike the Capex = D&A, it's a very lazy assumption that ignores the timing difference in investment and D&A catches up over time. r/Galagonya, you have 45% and 35% growth in the 2 divisions, there is no possibility that D&A = Capex in your 5 forecast year. Even then, I would put Capex as >100% of D&A for Terminal period (maybe 105 - 110%) depending on the industry itself. My Autos MD shouted my ear off when he saw I equalised Capex = D&A and he was absolutely right. 


Its a consulting company despite what the management says. There probably will be some changes in wc and capex, but based on the data from previous years we have, it shouldnt be that big. Of course if someone proves me otherwise by showing that this is indeed a software company, I am open to change my assumptions.

>3. Row 104, I don't think I've seen this way of building up EV before, this is...unusual. 

I calculated the EV in both ways. I like this method better as it allows for a dynamic WACC rate if needed and to see how multiples would change over time given the assumptions.


>
>4. Row 123-124 - these should be data tables, no need to hardcode them in. 

This valution isnt for a client, its for myself. Optimally I would have done a monte carlo as I think thats better than tables.



>5. Row 129 - why are you dividing Equity Value by Sales to get a Sales multiple? Need to be EV / Sales. 

True, good catch.



>6. Ditto on the LT growth point, Not comfortable with your company going from 35-45% CAGR down to 3% CAGR, just lengthen it out to like 2030 and trend it down. There is a formula where you can assume a trend down to your 3%,but I can't remember it from the CFA books tbh.

I agree that a three-stage model would have been better but I never finish the models I do for myself in one go. I always tinker with them over time. I will probably add a third stage later, but for now you could as well just disregard the terminal growth rate and just look at the exit sales/ev multiple I assume (back-calculated from the terminal growth rate) which is 5.2x in 2025 (still pretty big compared to peers).";t1_gblbiy6;t3_jq08mr;1604835280.0

If shelf space led to 1 major provider of critical products and that company had shelf space at every store, then it too would come under scrutiny. I never gave much thought to their search contract, because I always figured it was just to help compensate development of internet browsers that were otherwise free to the user. In the context of the antitrust situation, it doesn't seem so innocent any more and especially because it has held others back from developing scale.

I'll just throw out an additional risk... the lack of advertising revenue growth at non-tech firms has probably been one of the reasons that small distribution newspapers can't make it. If they, and other ad revenue based companies, are feeling similar pressures and complaining to their political representatives, it may create all the more desire to create regulation for internet advertising. This could come under the guise of protecting digital privacy and/or to promote search engine competition.

>What matters more is the context laid out by Letwin: there is a strain of political thought in America, independent of political party (although traditionally associated with Democrats), that is inherently allergic to concentrated power — monopoly in the populist sense, if not the legal one.  
*Hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits and like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times. “Monopoly”, as the word was used in America, meant at first a special legal privilege granted by the state. later it came more often to mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts. but it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to equality of opportunity.*

However, it's hard to argue with the author's point about the virtuous cycle Google has setup to feed this, with better searches leading to more traffic, which leads to more searches.  I'm not really sure how you can fix this, and allow other companies a better opportunity to compete.

I don't really think it's search that's necessarily a problem here, so much as it is their domination of online internet advertising.  A lot of the harms generated from Google (other than their constant cancelling of products) comes from the need to make money selling advertising.  It might be possible to separate out their current ad network for Android and other places from the ads sold on search, and de-integrate that part of the company.  This could potentially generate enough revenue for other companies to compete in search.  It would also fix some of the sneaky stuff going on with their domination of browsers, and subsequent removal of ad blocking capabilities from Chrome.

What bothers me here is the knock on effect of a rule that prevents them from paying for placement of their search.  If this happens that is a death sentence for Firefox, since they derive a massive amount of their revenue from this agreement.  With the movement of Edge to be a UI around the Chromium Embedded Framework, and Safari being based on a similar branch from WebKit, that would leave us back where we were when Microsoft's IE dominated browsers.

Both things that are not available to EV trucks, because the trucking companies don't control the infrastructure.  Further, modern freight trains are currently ""hybrids"" called diesel-electrics, where a diesel engine drives a DC generator, the output of which powers the traction motors which drive the locomotive.  So a simple retrofit could remove the diesel generator, and replace it with batteries.  Further freight trains have more weight to work with than a semi truck, and can shift that weight to the load being carried more effectively, since it's a small proportional amount.

Second, there seems to be an assumption that freight trains cannot also be made autonomous.  [A quick check will reveal this could have happened decades ago, but the costs weren't worth it, any more than it made sense to automate away the fry cooks at McDonalds.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnj75z/why-dont-we-have-driverless-trains-yet)  If this changes I'd expect the freight companies to do this.

So it seems that they think there will be radical transformation in the trucking industry, but the freight train industry will just sit there and not change.  It could be possible, I'm not familiar with the leadership of the various freight train companies, but I doubt it.";t3_jmdahn;t3_jmdahn;1604282520.0

I would like to someday buy a Tesla, but that's still a while off.

My responses on their model:

1. They do not model the full balance sheet. There are certain levels of capital where a firm's seemingly profitable growth can be value destructive. Alternatively, there are often scenarios where the growth is valuable for shareholders. Without a complete balance sheet, it's hard to know.

2. There is also not a full income statement that would allow me to view adjustments to past financials (especially for adjusted ebitda) and make a judgement on how much of that will continue.

3. I could not find an old model. Ideally, we should look at Ark's 2016 model and see how it compares on all of these metrics.

I say the above as a point of caution for you - what you do with it is your choice. Remember that the internet was also seen as a mega-large energy transition. Don't forget that the internal combustion engine was also a major shift from the steam engine and so we've seen this type of revolution before. The company that Watts ran producing steam engines or Daimler with the introduction of the combustion engine might be good comparables to see how the metrics turn out. This is not the first time in the history of the world that we've made a big leap. The only reason we live in suburbs is that we made a big leap away from burning wood with less than 5% energy efficiency.

I would take a step back and build a proper model if you want to do a DCF valuation. The markets have been frothy for a while and EV/EBITDA multiples that Ark uses have been popular. Eventually, there could be a change in attitude just like there is in Wall Street every decade (conglomerate boom, nifty fifty, portfolio insurance, dot-com stocks, housing never goes down, peak oil, etc.) and when those occur you need to have valuations built with solid forecasts.

Be aware I am neither for or against Tesla, have never held a position for or against them, I am definitely a fan of the cars from an automotive perspective, and I conduct financial research on a full time basis. I would like to someday buy a Tesla, but that's still a while off.

I recommend buying one if you have the means. Riding in my brother's Porsche seems pedestrian to me ever since I got a model 3. 

As to your responses to the ARK model I'm sure that if you spend the time to dig a little deeper you can find satisfactory answers. In particular the rate of change of Tesla's return on capital invested is staggering. 

>Remember that the internet was also seen as a mega-large energy transition. Don't forget that the internal combustion engine was also a major shift from the steam engine and so we've seen this type of revolution before. The company that Watts ran producing steam engines or Daimler with the introduction of the combustion engine might be good comparables to see how the metrics turn out. This is not the first time in the history of the world that we've made a big leap. The only reason we live in suburbs is that we made a big leap away from burning wood with less than 5% energy efficiency.

I completely agree. Without a doubt, identifying category winners within the above tectonic shifts, such as Microsoft, Ford, and Standard Oil in the early stages of the growth of those new markets would have been incredibly valuable. Given the obviousness of the current transition to renewables, it is strange to me that this sub spends so little effort trying to identify which company will be the category winner.

I think you might have missed my point. I'm saying that yes, big changes happen, but if you look at the track record of those companies, how much profit did it actually generate for shareholders? And how obvious was it to know which company would make those profits? Maybe this is the equivalent of buying into Motorola or Nokia on the premise of cell phone supremacy. Or Kodak realizing the potential of a photograph and the lasting memory it creates.

Take a step back and look at this big picture. There used to be 100+ automakers in this country. Of the ones that even did survive, how many are still around? And how many haven't been through bankruptcy? The odds of survival are extremely low even on the back of excellent technology.

I most assuredly did not miss your point.  Perhaps you missed mine. The practice of securities analysis is a holistic endeavor that draws on all aspects of economics, history, psychology, and mathematics to validate the price of an investment now and in the future. Identifying the category winner within a large new market is the ideal application of securities analysis. There are always good reasons why one company succeeds and another doesn't, discovering these reasons is the fruit of successful securities analysis. 

You mention the dot com bubble. I'm sure you'll agree that the market is not nearly as crowded with renewables plays as is was with internet companies in the year 1999. It is also obvious that the market penetration of EVs and renewable energy storage and generation is in its initial stages. Having lived through the dot com bubble I think we are closer to 1994 than 1999 within this analogy. Even at that time the superiority of Microsoft vs Pets.com was clear. In fact Microsoft ended up being the category winner of the .com era. Today the valuation of Microsoft has grown 100 times from 1994 levels.

It is clear from history that the category winner in the EV and renewables space will generate monstrous returns for investors. Your warning is already well appreciated by anyone who has spent any time studying the history of economics and civilization.

If you can correctly identify the winner, then that's perfectly fine. But in addition to identifying them, you have to price them appropriately too. Sometimes, it's not as simple as betting on the best horse, because it really comes down to what odds are embedded in the price. It's quite the same with any business.

Regarding Microsoft - you realize it took 16 years for them to reach their dot-com bubble prices, right? Are you prepared for a 16 year decline in the price of Tesla of 75% before it comes back just to break even?

> It is clear from history that the category winner in the EV and renewables space will generate monstrous returns for investors.

What history? Microsoft? You're taking a firm that requires no assets and has many network effects built into their software and comparing it to an asset intensive business?

> The flip side of your warning is what I am communicating to you.

You seem focused on stock prices. Let's get back to financial statements and profitability. I asked about owner earnings and you said that's not relevant. ""Stock prices"" are simply a voting tool in the short term - their long run price is determined by the cash flow they produce.

Oil, railway sector are pretty consolidated all over the world, the only growth part was nuclear sector of the company but now accounts very little to it's revenues to consider it. The growth scenario appeared when in China was announced that they wanted to become Carbon Neutral, so a new scenario appeared for Hollysys, where they could experience extraordinary growth if they successfully transit from oil to renewables.

I'm happy that you can get such a complete picture in 10 minutes, but my method is to know the company as much as I can and since I never analyzed a company like that the amount of time I spent learning new things on automation, railway and nuclear sector was worth for me, given the lack of knowledge I had in this sector. With this title I didn't want to give any impression of ""my hard work"", I just wanted to point out that I'm not an expert of the sector so I needed my time to understand better what I was talking about.   
Just to clear a few things, I don't invest in terms of return on time spent, but I'm not gonna to invest in something that I don't really understand. If it was a sector that I already know or deal with, it wouldn't take that much to give an honest opinion.

gaiz2o9;69;"Retail investors can’t buy private companies, so in theory the price of these companies will be lower. This is the so called illiquidity premium you mention.

Generally, portfolio companies are smaller than public companies. If you believe in the size premium, you could think about private equity as a way to get access to that risk premium.

The general partner has a say in the operations of the portfolio company. So for example, if the GP has owned 200 car dealerships in the past, maybe they could add value to a car dealership that they buy on behalf of the fund.

Private companies don’t have the same reporting rules as public companies. A GP can often use their relationship to get access to very confidential information on a private company that they wouldn’t be able to get on a public company.

Private equity returns tend to be smooth and lagged through downturns. If you add this to a portfolio, it mathematically reduces the volatility of the portfolio. To be blunt about it, these returns are fake, but much more palatable to institutional investors.";t3_jkgmnf;t3_jkgmnf;1604001027.0

gaj1jhb;3;"Traditional private equity is essentially levered small cap equities (market cap <$1B) where you just average out the returns over your holding period and you have less bankruptcy risk (because you get better treatment from lenders than you would on single company basis due to the lenders competing for deals across the portfolio and because the sponsor has better access to capital to save a flailing business than a flailing levered public small cap does). You pay fees for those two features but also because you get to tell your country club buddies that you invest in private equity. You can very nearly recreate traditional private equity yourself in the public market and plenty of people have written about doing so (Dan Rasmussen, every major consulting firm as well as Deloitte, etc). It used to be that these traditional PE deals were usually cheaper on an unlevered basis than their levered small cap counterparts as well, although that is largely no longer the case. In any case, the punch line is that for someone with most of their net worth in a market cap weighted index fund of some sort, moving some of that net worth to ""PE"" will almost certainly ""diversify"" their returns, i.e., reduce nominal draw downs of your net worth all else equal.";t3_jkgmnf;t3_jkgmnf;1604002202.0

But to the question, normally it's because the types of companies that are under PE are theoretically uncorrelated to market cycles, since they have longer holding periods, and are trying to do something different to most public cos. They are either building something, or transformingin some ways, which makes them different business in the end. They're insulated from market swings, which makes the management more focused on the task at hand. All together creates for less correlation.

gaj18dh;0;"because:

1. public equities tend to be more regulated. Private equities don't really have to answer to everyone. public entities tend to have to provision some funds for changes in regulation, leading to higher costs. On the flip side, this means private equities are more flexible with their structure, their strategy is more secretive, and their businesses can be incredibly niche.
2. private equities have different long term priorities. Typically for outsiders to get involved, they need a private equity company who buys out the business using the outsider's money. The PE compnay are in it to grow the business either organically or inorganically with m&a as their own profit is aligned with it. This means that the PE company, being the dominant shareholder, has a real vested interest to make sure that the company grows and the growth is sticky (i.e. permanant), and they typically have a real hand in hiring and firing the board- they can be extremely hands on.
3. Compare this with public equity - there is a signficiant proportion of silent investors - people who just buy and hold, do not participate in the management of the company and do not necessarily have an interest in long term holds (some are short term, some medium term). the power dynamic is typically entirely on the management being the driver to make returns. buyers of public equity also do not have the low level insight inside the business (they can't waltz into Apple HQ if they bought an apple share).";t3_jkgmnf;t3_jkgmnf;1604002053.0

gajgbx6;28;"Public companies trade daily, and the most recent trade is a good indicator of what the fair market value of an asset is.

Private assets will trade once in 5 years for a private equity fund, which makes it hard to determine a fair value at any time other than at time of sale.

PE funds typically have to estimate the value of their assets on a quarterly basis and there's a [fairly rigorous framework](https://asc.fasb.org/imageRoot/00/7534500.pdf) for coming up with the estimate. To /u/Texas2904's point, the manager does have much more discretion in coming up with a value of a private asset vs a public one.

In practice, managers tend to favor slowly changing their asset values, relying on the financial performance to come up with the estimate. If a recession hits, it isn't visible to the financial reporting for months, and the fund itself may not need to report the new value for another few months after that.

As a result of this, PE fund returns when taken at face value look a lot less volatile than and uncorrelated to public assets, even though both of these statements are untrue.";t1_gajawhi;t3_jkgmnf;1604009502.0

gaaio3m;18;I don’t know the stats but there have been massive redemptions from Greenlight. Some institutional investors evaluate the decision making processes of investment selection to determine whether it accomplishes a goal of theirs while giving less weighting to past performance. For example you might carve out an allocation for Greenlight because it maintains a short position in a “bubble basket” that is differentiated from other equity managers you’ve allocated to. You might see long exposures to value oriented companies at low multiples that performed well in past recessions and feel this aligns with something your portfolio is lacking. It’s also easier to justify keeping an allocation to a contrarian manager when you’re printing money across all of your other managers.

gabia5i;14;"No investor turns up to work and just switches on the ATM. If you look at the ""perfect strategy"", where you pick the top-performing stocks every few years...you still have massive, multi-year drawdowns.

The difficult part of the investment business isn't generating ideas, it isn't valuation...frankly, if you find those things hard then you are in the wrong business. It is turning up to work every day, getting your teeth kicked in, getting emails from people pulling their money, telling you that you don't what you are doing...this is what investing is.

If you are pulling down Einhorn, you have literally no idea about investing. The only way to get outperformance is to take the risk of being wrong. Most people in the industry think like you, they realise that being wrong isn't an emotional risk they can bear, and they end up closet indexing at Fidelity (most of this group will probably lose their job in the next few years). If you aren't comfortable with being wrong (anyone who says ""Oh, X fund manager is so bad"" usually has a huge problem with being wrong), do something else.

Btw, if you stick with investing long enough, you will see this story play out over and over again. I know a ""hotshot"" fund team that were acqu-hired by a big manager, they had no real track record but had a hot streak...opened new fund, self-destructed almost instantly. New Star Asset Management, huge firm in the UK composed of superstar ""brand name"" investors only that had done well in the most recent cycle, geniuses only...started in 2001, shut down in 2007. Brevan Howard, all the genius institutional investors thought: these guys are so dumb, terrible performance, even though the strategy was clear...everyone sold, like clockwork Howard starts printing, the fund is up 20% this year in a fund that was running single digit risk (they are up close to 100% in a few years). BlueCrest the same, apparently a guy who has been printing cash for two decades (Michael Platt) was a chump, Platt walked away from his investors, and has made 50%/year for five years. On and on and on.

Don't be results-based, don't chase performance, understand the strategy, and understand that executing a strategy often means continuing when it isn't working. No strategy prints every month, the only ones that do underperform through the cycle.

Since 2016, the average deposit premium for acquired banks with more than $3 billion of deposits was 14%. Currently, only 3 of the 186 banks with deposits greater than $3 billion trade for a deposit premium of 14% or greater. At the end of 2017, 49 of 148 banks traded with deposit premiums above 14%.

gaex6jb;7;"**Edit/TL.DR Endowment Model Portfolios require Liquidity and Low Volatility. These requirements in practice create a drag on absolute returns but on a risk adjusted basis (in terms of volatility) the endowment model typically outperforms Index ETFs of public equities.**

The author is a professional acquaintance of mine who is highly respected by many in our field. I get that this is the internet, arguments are rarely won here. However, the ease with which you've gone ad hominem is frustrating when I'm genuinely engaging with you.

Second, the implication of what she lays out is fairly obvious. Endowment funds are restricted by purpose, and have different time constraints, which requires low volatility and capital preservation. Furthermore, I'd add that the spending requirements on endowments per the IRS Tax Code force endowments into a lower vol higher liquidity portfolio anyways.

Therefore, institutional investors end up creating model portfolios that blend lower return low risk investments with fixed income components, with longer term private equity investments to meet liquidity needs. They also blend separate sets of asset classes in private equity and public securities to create a lower vol. portfolio. Private Equity by the way [has historically outperformed broader market indexes up until about 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-sec-may-open-the-gate-to-private-equity-for-the-masses-bad-idea-51573126200). The end result is a portfolio that often does underperform index ETFs of public equities on an absolute basis. However, index ETFs of public equities aren't suitable for the needs of an endowment portfolio because of the volatility/~~liquidity~~. Many of these endowments do have a public equity component in their portfolio... but it can't be the whole pie.

Critics are quick to point out over the last 10 years or so private equity has underperformed lower cost index ETFs. They fail to account for the fact that it's at best very challenging to compare the two asset classes on a risk adjusted basis. When it is done, using metrics like beta (which I believe are flawed for this purpose) Private Equity is the winner on a risk adjusted basis every time. Furthermore, proponents of the endowment model would counter that the unprecedented tilt towards Modern Monetary Theory by central banks around the world have inflated public asset prices and distorted the prevailing longer term relationship between Private Equities and Public Equities.

I'd actually take (what I suspect is) your side in this for institutions.. [many are unprepared to run an endowment model portfolio well.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1gj523tmfl2tt/David-Swensen-Is-Great-for-Yale-Is-He-Horrible-for-Investing) However, the David Swensens of the world are going to continue to do what they've been doing and it's entirely appropriate for them to do so. While there has been some crowding out of returns over the last few decades, incumbents in this space still retain a significant advantage and it shows when comparing the performance of various endowments.

On a separate note, many global institutions are starting to take private equity in house and go direct vs. outsourcing to GP's and their private equity fund model. The U.S. is significantly lagging this trend because the public is not willing to tolerate paying in house PE professionals with taxpayer dollars what they're worth to do it. They'd rather just pay PE firms 2% on committed capital and 20% on carry with a 10year lockup. Which is back ass wards.

Even I don't randomly announce my acquaintances on the internet, so I assume your response is as much a personal defense/justification as it is a real thesis on managing an endowment.

I'll start by also saying that ""endowment"" is a pretty broad term and one can't simply say that any pool of money attached to a non-profit should be treated or deployed the same way. I was speaking of universities, so I'll stick with that.

Firstly, the suggestion that index ETFs of public equities are/were a viable substitute for a managed endowment was ever suggested by anyone. That alone would of course be ridiculous as well as impractical.

Second, you're going to need to elaborate on ""spending requirements on endowments"". 1.4% excise tax is a hell of a deal and if anything is liberating, not restrictive. the tax code is far too lenient on endowments, and provides a cushion to endowment managers that they do not deserve.

Third, I think you may misunderstand exactly how most endowments are used (at least at major research institutions). Many large institutions have other sources of liquidity, and many departments have their own funding even outside the university itself. So the concept of an endowment as the entirety of a university's financial resources (or even as its primary source of operating funds) is pretty inaccurate. Your claims seem to be built on that assumption, however.

Anyway, there's a lot of random facts and opinions tossed in there that are really not pertinent. including some comments about ""global institutions"" which is pretty vague (meaningless?) but almost certainly irrelevant.

My point was and remains simply that endowment managers feel they need to *do something* to earn their keep, or else people might question the sanity of the status quo. As they rightly should...

So any manager caught ignoring trends would face questions about their purpose. and those would be tough answers. When following the trends results in good returns it's easy to make the argument that spending lots of money to maintain the creature these managers have created is ""clearly"" worth it... and in turn when the performance doesn't match the cost outlay, managers want to say they operate in a special scenario that makes direct comparison with literally every other scenario on the planet impossible? Sorry, but no.

Others would be held accountable. endowment managers think that shouldn't apply to them because ""it's complicated.""

""It's complicated"" also seems to be the crux of your argument, but you've given no good reason that one couldn't simply buy a basket of securities, some government bonds, and issue debt to satisfy liquidity concerns.

This is the basis of the lawsuit detailed in the article from Institution Investor.

The short answer is that by law it's 5% of AUM a year.

> Third, I think you may misunderstand exactly how most endowments are used...

I'm an insider. I know how they're used and how they vary by institution, purpose, intended beneficiary etc.

> My point was and remains simply that endowment managers feel they need to *do something* to earn their keep, or else people might question the sanity of the status quo. 

Action bias isn't specific to endowment managers. The status quo is questioned on a regular basis. 

> Others would be held accountable. endowment managers think that shouldn't apply to them because ""it's complicated."" 

Well this isn't exactly correct. endowment managers would take issue with being benchmarked to the S&P on the basis of absolute return alone. Which again is the implication of the lawsuit. Endowments have near term and longer term financial obligations, endowment managers back solve for these obligations with the assets they have by adjusting asset allocation and security selection to meet the obligations with as little risk as reasonably possible in terms of volatility. 

The resulting outcome is superior risk adjusted returns vs. a mix of public securities alone. 

> you've given no good reason that one couldn't simply buy a basket of securities, some government bonds, and issue debt to satisfy liquidity concerns. 

This actually would satisfy liquidity concerns but not volatility concerns.

The investment world is an extremely competitive place. If an endowment manager can get better risk adjusted returns using public securities alone, they will. Because they get a lot of upside in performance based compensation, and they'll probably be the next David Swensen. We don't necessarily want to do private equity, it's a pain in the ass in a lot of ways. On the other hand, there's no weekly meeting for endowment managers where we all get together at night, in the woods, dressed in white hoods, burn some crosses and conspire to protect the private equity industry and their fat 2% fee with 20% carry. We're competing against each other to provide a superior product for our clients. I'll invest in bitcoin and David Portnoy stock picks if that's what works. 

Endowment models that include private equity investments on average provide better risk adjusted returns than they would without. This is why the PE industry is exploding, like it or not.

>5% per year

Misleading. You don’t have to spend 5% of AUM on new cars, buildings, etc. per year. And that’s not on high from the IRS either.

>managers would take issue with being benchmarked

Everyone takes issue with that. Everyone wants to explain why they had a bad year, and everyone who beats is proud they had a good year. It’s still a fact. You stated a long term capital appreciation objective. So in the long term, you have to beat the “free” alternative. In pretty much any business, if you want to get paid, you have to prove that whatever the “free” alternative to you is, that alternative is somehow inferior.

But you have other objectives as well, so let’s say you didn’t beat the free alternative, we have to justify why.

You were trying to avoid volatility.

Find me an endowment that doesn’t clamp down when the market is volatile, I dare you. How many institutions went straight to a hiring/spending freeze over the last 6 months. Volatility is either relevant to you or it isn’t. You can’t claim volatility as a driving concern that reduces performance, and then tweak out and respond like you have massive exposure to market swings unless you actually do. In which case we are back at the beginning and volatility wasn’t a primary objective—or you failed at it. (I’m using that as a term of art, not saying managers are personal failures... just to be clear)

Coupled with your “long term” objective, there are cheaper ways to survive market volatility. Like, perhaps, go on vacation for 6 months and check in after you get home. Barring some sort of NNT book worthy event, that is.

So let’s say you’re Harvard and you lost 30% while you were busy sucking your own dick and trying to decide if you should buy a light crimson dark crimson or gold trash can for your office.

Can you still meet your institution’s cash needs? Hopefully yes, because you have other tools beyond tapping the equity in your portfolio. And that’s really the only purpose of an endowment. To the people who truly matter, you either showed up or you didn’t. They don’t care if you’re the most popular guy at the conference this year...

Although there is the usual pissing contest that occurs between all investment professionals, so everyone wants to be the BSD...

All that to say, you can absolutely balance that portfolio to throw off 4% per year, or whatever your board mandates, without needing to pay PE level fees to do it. And the mandate is, or should be, that you have to do it quietly, consistently, and cheaply.

But you hit the real issue at the end which is that ultimately this shit is driven by compensation, and the proported “goals” are all couched in terms of keeping those numbers up. Y’all aren’t running an investment bank, and you’re not a pension fund that tax payers should have to bail out. You don’t get to have it both ways. You still have to be significantly better than “free” not “at least as good as free, with different standards for our compensation because we have to get you 4% a year over an infinite timeline.”

Even if you don't believe in the various strategies, it's important to understand them and see how they may or may not apply to your investments and the environment that we happen to be in.

One thing that he didn't talk about much is macro.  The current environment is very macro-driven so it's important to take a step back from just equity analysis and consider other asset classes, including foreign ones. For example, MMT is being talked about quite a bit these days and instead of examining the soundness of the theory, it's important to understand how proponents claim it works and acknowledge that it will influence policy moving forward.  In other words, traditional monetary theory probably works fine when interest rates aren't at the zero bound but when they are we need to introduce MMT-like concepts.";t3_jibjtl;t3_jibjtl;1603756837.0

It's not that you might/might not be right about your predictions, it's that the future is so  very difficult to forecast and even if you are correct, the margin for error in estimating the future is very difficult - so knowing the price you pay implies so much and it is much harder to estimate whether you have a margin of safety or not.

I think you can rationally say you fall into the camp of value investing in the style of Buffett, but maybe not Graham (as much).  I don't think any of that is right or wrong, they just emphasize different things.

(1) Quality of a company (and therefore, your expectations about the future of the company)

(2) Whether the current price accurately reflects the quality of the company and its future.

I think even Warren Buffett's strategy has changed over the years - although i admit it's hard to separate the fact he has just too much capital to invest from his change in strategy

I don't think Ben graham value will ever come back - but i also think that if Ben Graham were some immortal being that never died, Ben Graham 2020 would probably not invest like Ben Graham 1934 anymore. right now any 16 year old with a computer built in the last 15 years can run simple, instant screens and find the graham stocks, when this is so easy, you have no alpha left, the algorithmic traders will eliminate any possible alpha.

the economy has also changed - you can't really value a service-based business on book-value, it's an absolutely meaningless number, it could theoretically work for banks or industrials - why eliminate the majority of the US economy from your universe?

i can say the same for P/E - i can use salesforce as an example, their cost of client acquisition is high (SG&A is \~50%) - if they wanted to they could become extremely profitable overnight, it's a high margin business with expensive switching costs once they win a client - but they're betting that they're in a missive market so the plan is to maximize market share and once the overall pie plateau's they cut the expenses and generate a s\*\*\* ton of FCF -

I'm less familiar with the ""classical"" roman empire, but the medieval empire spent half it's 1000 year existence with the emperor fighting the wealthy provincial land owners - same with Medieval western Europe.

A lot of parts of the country, and Canada are already having heat waves. Near Alaska it hit 40 degrees celsius. That's fucked up. But let's say that none of this is happening today and won't happen tomorrow.

Doesn't matter. The world is going heat pump. Why? Because it's cheaper and more efficient to heat than with a traditional furnace. And it offers air conditioning. And it can run on solar and other renewables. And it runs at greater than 100% efficiency, so far beyond NG and electric baseboard heaters and electric furnaces. And it can be fully integrated into any smart home setup.
